You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse      mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu ","comp.windows.x"],["From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Subject: Re: ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION FACT SHEET Reply-To: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Organization: Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer Science Lines: 26  In article <1993Apr13.150018.641@lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com> dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com writes:  >My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region >in the past three years.

The \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ ","soc.religion.christian"],["From: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Subject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator: robin@volans Nntp-Posting-Host: volans Reply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Organization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA Distribution: na Lines: 141  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about  1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town.  Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient.

No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.  As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....  During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an \"economist\" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly \"supply side\" policy, since taxes do not \"cause\"  economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be  explained by watching population waves roll through the years and  create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he is.

I am new to X, so please excuse my lax (read: \"probably incorrect\") terminology!    Environment: Sun Sparc 10, SunOs 4.1.3.  X11R5 path level 23.  My X process is started by xdm.    i) I want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to      display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!       The setup is as follows:          lib/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc         ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc                                     tvtwm       There are also .tvtwmrc and .Xdefaults files in the (~user) home      directory.       The xsetroot in Xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm      login window as expected - very nice!       Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as      expected.       The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the      the users session startup?   ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.       ie: real key       key shown on screen          ------------   -------------------          hash           back slash          tilde          pipe          double quote   at symbol          pound          hash          cursor key     not recognised       This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have      installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.       Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as      expected!    Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)   And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?

This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you need your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly wouldn't know they had to.)

Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an \"Americanization\" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \"American\" or not is irrelevant.   >If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  >central to the original article.

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?

Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana Lines: 54   Yo, Whaz up!!!  Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then. Also, somebody check to see if they had them in 88.....  Peace.

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with \"Kartagener's syndrome\", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. \"Situs inversus\" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion. I would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of which there is probably one at NCSU.  -km ","sci.med"],["From: noye@midway.uchicago.edu (vera shanti noyes) Subject: Re: Serbian genocide Work of God?

The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \"truth\" is not always \"true\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \"There are no absolutes\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.  >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical  >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding  >Biblical interpretation.  So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.   --  Virgilio \"Dean\" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics    CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee     \"Bullwinkle, that man's intimidating a referee!\"   |    My boss is a     \"Not very well.

I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  The sooner there's peace in the region the better it is for them and everyone else.

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled \"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil\".  The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  In ALD patients who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.  ---Dale Cook ","sci.med"],["Subject: Space FAQ 01/15 - Introduction From: leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech) Expires: 6 May 1993 19:53:44 GMT Organization: University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill Keywords: Frequently Asked Questions Supersedes: <intro_730956346@cs.unc.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: mahler.cs.unc.edu Lines: 310  Archive-name: space/intro Last-modified: $Date: 93/04/01 14:39:10 $      FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO      INTRODUCTION      This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).       INDEX TO LINKED POSTINGS      I've attempted to break the postings up into related areas. There isn't     a keyword index yet; the following lists the major subject areas in each     posting.

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !     (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the \"Zionist entity\". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems.

It should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders, i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders (under the control of other ones among its orders) is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if part of the memory is used as a \"function table\", then \"looking up\" a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify, or rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which controls this \"looking up\", and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question.  On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.\"  david cary, tenor, e- and comp. engineering (finger caryd@a.cs.okstate.edu). 227 S. 163 E.

I don't have to \"try reading a bit\", Pat.  I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant.  I'd like a source for that statement about \"the reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much as they would like\"; I just don't buy it.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali Disaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We have never got any of the bodies back.\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the information\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means \"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\", \"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common denominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \"begin\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \"begin\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  --     tom lane    organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie ","comp.graphics"],["From: kastle@bernoulli.WPI.EDU (Jacques W Brouillette) Subject: Re: ARCTIC WHEELS AUTO SHOW Organization: Worcester Polytechnic Institute Lines: 5 NNTP-Posting-Host: bernoulli.wpi.edu  --   : I want only two things from this world, a 58 Plymouth and a small  :   : OPEC nation with which to fuel it.

Couple hours after >you \"feel\" sober? What? Or should I just work with \"If I drink tonight, I >don't ride until tomorrow\"?  This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the \"creative excuses\" offered the judge by others.  After listening to a number of \"Well, I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up\" versions, I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than impressed with any of them.  This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.  The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: \"Well son, those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for your self?\"  \"Well Sir\", meekly the defenant replied, \"I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.\" He offered nothing more or less.

I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\" For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All  Moscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they  mean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and  drive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to  Armenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed \"back door.\"  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips.  (It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy is still possible.

Look at what the Bush administration did to get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been dealt onb the White House Lawn. And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any moral qualms about the raid... The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_ successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will filter this so that the general public will think the BD's are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed moral qualms are not important to the issue.

Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my guess he was wearing the exact same duds.    The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo.    Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties.  With salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it was meant to be.

X X XGOALS OF THE CONTEST: X X    * To write the most Obscure/Obfuscated C program under the rules below. X    * To show the importance of programming style, in an ironic way. X    * To stress C compilers with unusual code. X    * To illustrate some of the subtleties of the C language. X    * To provide a safe forum for poor C code.  :-) X X XRULES: X X    To help us with the volume of entries, we ask that you follow these rules: X X    1) Your entry must be a complete program. X X    2) Your entry must be <= 3217 bytes in length.  The number of characters X       excluding whitespace (tab, space, newline), and excluding any ; { or } X       followed by either whitespace or end of file, must be <= 1536. X X    3) Your entry must be submitted in the following format: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: y or n   (n => this is a new entry, y => this replaces an older entry) Xtitle: title of entry        (see comments below) Xentry: Entry number from 0 to 7 inclusive  (your 1st entry should by 0) Xdate: Date/time of submission in UTC     (see comments below) Xhost: Machine(s) and OS(s) under which your entry was tested X Use tab indented lines if needed X---remark--- X    Place remarks about this entry in this section.  It would be helpful if X    you were to indent your remarks with 4 spaces, though it is not a X    requirement.  Also, if possible, try to avoid going beyond the 79th X    column.  Blank lines are permitted. X---author--- Xname: your name Xorg: School/Company/Organization Xaddr: postal address X use tab indented lines to continue X don't forget to include the country Xemail:  Email address from a well known site or registered domain. X        If you give several forms, list them on separate tab indented lines. Xanon: y or n   (y => remain anonymous, n => ok to publish this info) X---info--- XIf your program needs an info file, place a uuencoded copy of it in Xthis section.  In the case of multiple info files, use multiple info Xsections.  If your entry does not need a info file, skip this section. X---build--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of the command(s) used to compile/build your program Xin this section.  It must uudecode into a file named 'build'.  The resulting Xfile must be 255 bytes or less. X---program--- XPlace a uuencoded copy of your program in this section.  It must uudecode Xinto a file named is 'prog.c'.  The resulting file must follow rule #2. X---end--- X X      Regarding the above format: X X * The title must match the expression: [a-zA-Z0-9_=][a-zA-Z0-9_=+-]* X   and must be 1 to 12 characters in length. X X   It is suggested, but not required, that the title should X   incorporate your username; in the case of multiple authors, X   consider using parts of the usernames of the authors. X X * The date in the ---entry--- section should be given with respect X   to UTC.  The format of the date should be as returned by asctime()  X   using the C locale.  (see guidelines for more info) X X * You may correct/revise a previously submitted entry by sending X   it to the contest email address.  Be sure to set 'fix' in the  X   ---entry--- section to 'n'.  The corrected entry must use the same  X   title and entry number as submittion that is being corrected.  Be  X   sure that you note the resubmittion in the ---remark--- as well. X X * With the exception of the header, all text outside of the above  X   format may be ignored by the judges.  If you need tell the judges X   something, put it in the ---remark--- section, or send a separate X   Email message to the judges. X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

X XABOUT THIS FILE: X X    This file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to X    the International Obfuscated C Code Contest (IOCCC for short). X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts. X X    Last, but not least, winners receive international fame and flames!  :-) X X XFOR MORE INFORMATION: X X    You may contact the judges by sending Email to the following address: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X X    Questions and comments about the contest are welcome. X X    One may obtain a copy of the current rules, guidelines or mkentry X    program.  To obtain all 3 of them, send Email to the address above  X    and use the subject 'send rules'.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game.

Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??   >Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural >affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total >waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from >simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago, from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left, but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was  right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster or better as a result, is absurd.  Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn. And that was my original point.  Mike ","rec.motorcycles"],["From: berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu (David Berger) Subject: 101 Keyboard wanted.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.

What's up? |  | This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes | months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly. | Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a | specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we | aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in | Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to | Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this | debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but | keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles | concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians, | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.  1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.  |  | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us, | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews, | we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected | from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the | same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this. |  | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments | into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to | the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to | everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except | for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship.  People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). |  | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin | and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer | binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior | should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still | useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While | we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at | self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral | guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc. | These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same | function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in | the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that | given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important. |  I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).  | In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of | tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's | resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early | Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish | Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but | that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then. | Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also | implies gatherings on that day. |  | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to | worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day | Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a | regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and | that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.  Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\" with \"go to a worship service.\" |  | It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See | Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about | judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific | day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue | that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col | 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly | mentions Sabbath.)  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. |  | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word | \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish | day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the | day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It | distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship. | (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There | are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians | support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish | Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the | Lord's Day. |  Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day of every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.  --clh] ","soc.religion.christian"],["From: geos56@Judy.UH.EDU Subject: WholeSale TV sets.

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.  >The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for >a first time rider.

If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).

Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.  --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com ","talk.politics.guns"],["From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) Subject: Vandalizing the sky Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana Lines: 50  yamauchi@ces.cwru.edu (Brian Yamauchi) writes:  >enzo@research.canon.oz.au (Enzo Liguori) writes: >>WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  >>1.

Center for Regional Studies Lines: 106   04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir  By NEJLA SAMMAKIA  Associated Press Writer     GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner  of the Caucasus.  The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \"Lezghistan\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \"The police don't force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.     --  David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ?

This would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the session key. Just take modem-lines instead of secure fax.

They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the  socialists such as myself who have been persecuted.    Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking.  In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook  remember.  Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply \"ask\" their chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be \"nice\" boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.

Reply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) Distribution: world News-Software: FSUUCP 1.2 R4 Lines: 111        Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.  I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved. I also think that this will not happen, as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind, too.

Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.         Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)  >The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or >records of SERIOUS mental diseases.         This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.  >Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun >-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun. >It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? >You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...         At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.          But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                >Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): >Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' >for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. >Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short  >time befor the crime. > >Use of knives: >It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. >You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open >in public -rigth ??          This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).          Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.         >Individual vs masses: >Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some >extent.... >Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? >What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of  >all the others ??         The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.           If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own guns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.  >The issue: >I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.         The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.  >We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one.... >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. >But should it have to be like that ??         Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.  >Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??         No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be \"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.     >If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think >it should be free to buy guns ??         I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.         But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the    \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique          2      \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:   --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to       employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;   --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone       calls and data, under proper court or other legal       order, when necessary to protect our citizens;   --   the effective and timely use of the most modern       technology to build the National Information       Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and       the competitiveness of American industry in the global       marketplace; and    --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export       high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.           3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.       For additional details, call Mat Heyman, National Institute of    Standards and Technology, (301) 975-2758.     ---------------------------------      QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S    TELECOMMUNICATIONS INITIATIVE        Q:   Does this approach expand the authority of government  agencies to listen in on phone conversations?     A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with  no new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on  a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation  encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to  decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a  court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They  would then present documentation of this authorization to  the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and  obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug  smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are  stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key  escrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent  entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the  Administration have yet to determine which agencies will  oversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure  how strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption  systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will  remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow  system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of  cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all  potential users that there are no unrecognized  vulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the  Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in  this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the  President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet  officials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on  encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify  as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have  briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the  decisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access  encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the  microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product  manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip  manufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,  California, and will sell the chip to encryption device  manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed  to other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating  the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological  solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be  willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more  powerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be  considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow  mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product  that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive  than others readily available today, but it is just one  piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to  encryption technology, which the Administration is  developing.   The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption  threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,  we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have  effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every  American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an  unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a  false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is  an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,  and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,  balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper  Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton  Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from  that of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption  technology in telecommunications and computing and are  committed to working with industry and public-interest  groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'  privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law  enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime  and terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use  the government hardware?     A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control  requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is  required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The  same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the  attractions of this technology is the protection it can give  to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.  With this  in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a  case-by-case basis for U.S. companies seeking to use these  devices to secure their own communications abroad.  We plan  to review the possibility of permitting wider exportability  of these products.

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing.    --- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA Internet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055 ","sci.electronics"],["From: atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) Subject: Re: Ancient Books Organization: National Association for the Disorganized Lines: 20  cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb) writes:  >If I talk with an atheist and tell him the New Testament is an historically  >reliable document, what reasons would I give him?    I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid products to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\" Isn't this ratio the issue?  What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).  -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>  ","sci.med"],["From: toml@miles.ca.boeing.com (Tom Locke) Subject: $22600 Subaru SVX -  Good deal?

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out.

Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick  scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!  As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!  As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game.

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye            cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the            lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)            Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this            world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit            that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)            In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the            devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he            that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)            Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him.

Whose \"Jesus of the Bible\" do you mean?       This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but       rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

When I mentioned that the Mormon belief is      that Jesus needed to be saved, I put forward some quotes from the late      apostle, Bruce McConkie. The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I      have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue.

Koberg,   Just a couple of minor corrections here...   1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \"saved\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.

I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \"outer darkness.\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer darkness.\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\" -away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \"awesome\" thought.    \"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\"  Of course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever wont's.\"    \"Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.\" \"There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.\" --Rex   ","soc.religion.christian"],["From: ramirez@IASTATE.EDU (Richard G Ramirez) Subject: Re: SUMMARY: Borland/Microsoft Database C Libraries Reply-To: ramirez@IASTATE.EDU (Richard G Ramirez) Organization: Iowa State University Lines: 4  Could you post a description of ObjectBase, your chosen product.

Several question do come to mind concerning the \"success\" we all hope for  in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to  be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \"interim\" self-control.  Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible  vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the  negotiating process) more \"relaxed\" proposals for this\"interim\" period?  How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their  \"maximalist\" approaches as stated above?

If I could get the DB25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the BIOS routines that support it, I could map all this into my target system?  Anyone know where I might get the pin-out or the BIOS routines? Are the routines published someplace convenient?  Thanks! Silvio  PS....please send email to me directly!

I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.

A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely  that we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.              Q   Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.              Q   Going to name a drug czar this weekend?              MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.              Q   And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going  to be focused on the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)  Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the  bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)  *     *     *   To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only  wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

After a while we got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone - electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus.    But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a  lot of them got \"funny\" in the LCD display.  A black stain would spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone).    What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway.

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.   > 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.  a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.   > 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches >    set but it is much slower.  a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus   > 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.  a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.   > 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many >    cases.  a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.   > 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.  a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.   > 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)  a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have an Graphics Ultra yet.)

I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me  that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.    As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food  manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a  known flavor enhancer.   Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite,  may well be true.

Lines: 82     UPI Washington DC, Update Desk   4/15/93    For the past several months the Clinton administration has been   stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most   leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the    economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area   of jobs creation.    The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \"It's the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Let's see, if Alexander destroyed Tyre, and people move back, and they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there and still call it Tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt.

I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities along the coast of Finland.

You still haven't offered  I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.  Rick.

He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.  >John Eaton >!hp-vcd!johne ","talk.politics.misc"],["From: acifuent@isluga.puc.cl (Alejandro Cifuentes) Subject: Q: Change icons forever???

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on  The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using.

Neil Smith Distribution: usa Nntp-Posting-Host: blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO  80523 Lines: 116  Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the  effect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters  outside his store?

If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?    $0.02, doug.

A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime.  And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.  On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we  didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home  watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our  house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the  direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off  the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.  Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.  We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down  with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's  happened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we  say, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No,  leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.  We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We  held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an  axe, and then with a crowbar.  When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them  with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,  pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father  in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured  several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But  they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them.  The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go  into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of  about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no  one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you,  woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\" She says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father  was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian  and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,  \"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he  brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You  don't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this  man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,  too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't  know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night.  Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were  from Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you  have our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room.  So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around  one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,  investigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\" Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take  Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take  Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor's.  The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles, ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a  landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking  into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians  weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they  poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still, up there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding  one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling  the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,  and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the  furniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed  him down.  The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians, they had left for another city.  The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you  crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the  apartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave  this apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went  downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the  other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.  They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.  With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely  accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We  were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the  troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been  even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide.  Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock  in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were  about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It  was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people  there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It  was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a  man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces  were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...  Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my  father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.  I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.  I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They  weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The  inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They  weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were  at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us.  As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus  station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.  Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops  suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.  At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could  happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds.  Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass  disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There  were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all.  They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

(Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict!

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \"Black Bears\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful. We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good about it.       THE PRESS:  Thank you                                   END       10:10 A.M.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \"last used in Detroit in 48\".

Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   -------------------------------------------------- >We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948.   Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \"Black Day in July\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.  Is the point irrelevant?  No.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make the rules, that's a different question.  If society is who should make the rules, that's yet another.

What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \"justice\" system.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have no reason to doubt it either.  Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.

The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost  every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they  stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure. They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the  Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of  Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is  known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the  Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the  Boobtist Witch-hunt.   Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with  their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on  their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and  more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a  handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop  'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.

Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC-  quality station.

Satan and his followers have rebelled against God, and are not \"children (=followers/redeemed) of God,\" but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of salvation.  # #        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the #        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked \"one\"; #        (Matthew 13:38)  So?  --This illustrates nicely what I just said: the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus (and have shown \"works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us about \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.  #  This is really a red herring.

The issue of \"official doctrine\" is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to as \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen.

Christ's pity on the crowds as being \"like sheep without a shepherd\" rings true to me. If these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed  judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any  positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).

Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

Note the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                   > A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the > \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.                > A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the > \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.  Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.

Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time.

The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false assessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant.

Take a second look at \"non-toxic, non-flammable\":    MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.   Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \"non-toxic\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \"nonflammable _smoke_\"   So:   Take a little \"nonflammable aerosol\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.   If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call 713-279-1066.     --  Jaclyn Brandt jbrandt@NeoSoft.com -- ","comp.graphics"],["From: enf021@cck.coventry.ac.uk (Achurist) Subject: Re: Abyss: breathing fluids Nntp-Posting-Host: cc_sysk Organization: Coventry University Lines: 31  In article <93089.204431GRV101@psuvm.psu.edu> Callec Dradja <GRV101@psuvm.psu.edu> writes: >I am a bit nervous about posting this beacause it is begining to >stray fron the topic of space but then again that doesn't seem to >stop alot of other people. :-) > >With all of this talk about breathing at high pressures, I began >to think about the movie Abyss.

Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to go the 'right' way on the energy curve).

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?   And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery.

Organization: UUNET Technologies Inc, Falls Church, VA, USA Lines: 31 NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net     Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.    I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 107  [An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]                         April 16, 1993        INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY                              PROPOSAL         The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement  on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of  millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  posed by new technology.         However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  by the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an  80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  communications products.         This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .         First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  based on open standards.         Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.           Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  inquiries?           In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  digital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution  ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  yet.  Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  using it.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  which the government or others could break the code without  securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  of the investigation would then be made public.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.   FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director Daniel J.

Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The world hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.  And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25. I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very Person who created me and who loves me.

You have to provide not only a colormap but also a border.  The default border is CopyFromParent, which is not valid when the window's depth doesn't match its parent's.  Specify a border-pixmap of the correct depth, or a border-pixel, and the problem should go away.  There is another problem: I can't find anything to indicate that CopyFromParent makes any sense as the border_width parameter to XCreateWindow.  Your Xlib implementation probably defines CopyFromParent as zero, to simplify the conversion to wire format, so you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero, due to the Xlib implementation not providing stricter type-checking.  (To be fair, I'm not entirely certain it's possible for Xlib to catch this.)       der Mouse      mouse@mcrcim.mcgill.edu "],["sci.med",5.0,5.0,"From: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Subject: Re: ORGAN DONATION AND TRANSPLANTATION FACT SHEET Reply-To: geb@cs.pitt.edu (Gordon Banks) Organization: Univ. of Pittsburgh Computer Science Lines: 26  In article <1993Apr13.150018.641@lmpsbbs.comm.mot.com> dougb@ecs.comm.mot.com writes:  >My wife cannot donate blood because she has been to a malarial region >in the past three years.

The \"so sacred it's secret\" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic \"Christians\" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).  2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\" (Matt. 19:11).  3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now\" (John 16:12).  4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).  5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. --  ------------------------------------------------------------------------          Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City                     jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ "],["sci.med",5.0,5.0,"From: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Subject: Critique of Pressure Point Massager Originator: robin@volans Nntp-Posting-Host: volans Reply-To: robin@ntmtv.com (Robin Coutellier) Organization: Northern Telecom Inc, Mountain View, CA Distribution: na Lines: 141  As promised, below is a personal critique of a Pressure Point Massager  I recently bought from the Self Care Catalog.  I am very pleased with  the results.  The catalog description is as follows:   The Pressure Point Massager is an aggressive physical massager   that actually kneads the tension out of muscles ... much like a  professional shiatsu masseur.  The powerful motor drives two  counter-rotating \"thumbs\" that move in one-inch orbits --  releasing tension in the neck, back, legs and arms.   Pressure Point Massager    A2623   $109  To order or receive a catalog, call (24 hours, 7 days) 1-800-345-3371 or fax at 1-800-345-4021.  ******** NOTE: When I ordered the massager, the item number was different, and the price was $179, not $109.  When I received it, I glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one.  I was   QUITE annoyed to see a $70 difference in price.  I called them about it, and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers, although it looks and works exactly the same.  He told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one, using the price difference as a reason for return.  In fact, since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory (I received this one in 3 days), he told me I could  use the one I already have until the new one arrives, then return the old  one.  VERY reasonable people. ********  I have long-term neck, shoulder and back pain (if I were a building, I  would be described as \"structurally unsound :-) ).  I have stretches  and exercises to do that help, but the problem never really goes away.   If, for whatever reason, I do not exercise for a while (illness, not enough time, lazy, etc.), the muscles become quite stiff and painful and, thus,  more prone to further strain.  Even with exercise, I sometimes require  physical therapy to get back on track, which 1st requires a doctor visit  to get the prescription for p.t.    The tension in my neck, if not released, eventually causes a headache (sometimes confused with a sinus headache) over my left eye.  When my  physical therapist has massaged my neck, and the sub-occipital muscles  in particular (the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull), the  headache usually eased within a day, although it hurts like hell to  while it is being massaged.  I ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what I was wishing someone would invent --a machine that would massage, NOT VIBRATE, my  neck and sub-occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in  the past, that I could use by myself.  No doctor visit or inconvenient  p.t. appts for a week later would be needed to use it.  I could get up  in the middle of the night and use it, if necessary.  I have been using it for about a week or so now, and LOVE it.  The base unit is about a 14\" x 9\" rectangle, about 3-3/4\" high, with handles on each side, and it plugs into an average outlet.  The two metal \"thumbs\" are about  1-1/2\" in diameter and protrude about 2-1/2\" above the base.  The thumbs  are covered with a gray cloth that is non-removable.  They are located more  toward one end, rather than centered (see figure below).  They move in  either clockwise or counter-clockwise directions, depending on which side  of the switch is pushed, and are very quiet.  It can be used from either side.  For instance, the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck, depending on which direction you approach it.                    _______________________________                 |  __    _______________    __  |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  \\^^/   \\^^/  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |   ||     ||   |  |  | |                 | |  |  |  |  |  | |                 | |  |  |_______________|  |  | |                 | |__|      |__| |                 |_______________________________|   For the neck/head, the user varies the amount of pressure used by (if  laying down) allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and/or  neck to rest on the thumbs.  The handles can also be used if sitting or standing, applying pressure with the arms/wrists.  Since my wrists are also impaired (I'm typing this over an extended period of time), and I  don't have someone living with me who can apply it, laying down works  well for me.  For my back, I sit in a high-backed kitchen chair, position the massager behind me at whatever point I want massaged, and lean back lightly (or not so lightly) against it.  The pressure of leaning back holds it in place.   If I want to massage the entire spine, I simply move it down a few inches  whenever I feel like it.  For my back, this machine is far superior to use  than the commonly used \"home-made\" massager of 2 tennis balls taped together  (with the balls, position (against a wall or door) them over the spine and  move the body up and down against them).  The tennis balls are better than  nothing, but difficult to use for very long, especially if your quads are  not in good shape, and my long hair gets (painfully) in the way if I don't  pin it up first.  As far as I'm concerned, the easier something like this  is to use, the more likely I'll use/do it.  If there are multiple  considerations/hassles, I'm more likely to not bother with it.  Not only has this machine helped with my headaches, but my range of motion  for my neck and back are greatly increased.  The first time I used it on my neck/sub-occipital muscles, however, I overdid it and pressed too hard against it, which resulted in a very tender, almost bruised area for a few days.  I laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice, which helped.   After that, I was more gradual about applying pressure.  At this point,  the pain in the sub-occipital area is now minimal while being massaged.   I also learned to use VERY LIGHT pressure on my lower back, which is the  most vulnerable point for me.  It also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades, although, again, it took a few days of massaging (just a few minutes at a time) to really work it out.  I highly recommend this product if you have similar problems, although I cannot vouch for its durability (it seems pretty sturdy), since I've had it such a short time.  I plan to use it not only to ease tension, but also  to loosen the muscls BEFORE exercising (and maybe after, too).  I have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks, so this  was very timely  for me.  This is the 1st product I've ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co-worker.  The catalog states they have been in business since 1976.  It contains quite a few health care products and, while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products, they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do.  Definitely a step above some other ones I've seen such as \"Dr. Leonards Health Care Catalog\" or \"Mature Wisdom\". I'm only 37, but have ended up on some geriatric-type mailing lists (no big surprise here :-) ).  I consider many of those products to be rip-offs,  particularly targeted toward the elderly, with dubious health benefits.  I apologize for the length of this, but it's the kind of info _I_ would  like to know before ordering something thru the mail.

Dr. N. told me that last year, he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not the only orthopedists in the town.  Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD patient.  He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to the knees).

No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.

What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit  (2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased. Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.  Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time. Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.  As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....  During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an \"economist\" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government policy, particularly \"supply side\" policy, since taxes do not \"cause\"  economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be  explained by watching population waves roll through the years and  create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he is.

Unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  If I manually type xsetroot... in an      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as      expected.       The question is: How do I retain the background from the login window      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the      the users session startup?   ii) When I open an Xterm on the Sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.       ie: real key       key shown on screen          ------------   -------------------          hash           back slash          tilde          pipe          double quote   at symbol          pound          hash          cursor key     not recognised       This is very annoying!  Is X at fault here or the machine setup?  I have      installed the xterm drivers that came with X11R5 in both terminfo and      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.       Typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as      expected!    Any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes  place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --   ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)   And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?

This, at least, has already been determined: The Blue Cross medical coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future national system. To get emergency medical care, anyone so insured must always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital, you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.  In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,  you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do so for medical reasons) the hospital must.

You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel  that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum  you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line,  lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan  to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is  nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in  x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship,  that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel  free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists, the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian criminal organizations.  Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. You, and  those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.  Not a chance.

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.   Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an \"Americanization\" of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and whether it is \"American\" or not is irrelevant.   >If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not  >central to the original article.

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted, additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.    Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.  euclid  >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      \"...dammit, not a programmer!  = >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >--  >=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= >=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   = >=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             = >=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      \"...dammit, not a programmer!  = -- Euclid K.       standard disclaimers apply \"It is a bit ironic that we need the wave model [of light] to understand the propagation of light only through that part of the system where it leaves no trace.\"  --Hudson & Nelson (_University_Physics_) "],["sci.electronics",10.0,10.0,"From: pw@panix.com (Paul Wallich) Subject: Re: Help with ultra-long timing Organization: Trivializers R Us Lines: 16  In <1pqu12$pmu@sunb.ocs.mq.edu.au> johnh@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au (John Haddy) writes: >In article <C513wI.G5A@athena.cs.uga.edu>, mcovingt@aisun3.ai.uga.edu (Michael Covington) writes: >|> Instead, use a quartz crystal and divide its frequency by 2 40 times >|> or something like that. >...

Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana Lines: 54   Yo, Whaz up!!!  Earlier, I was reading on the net about using Splitfire plugs.  One guy was thinking about it and almost everybody shot him to hell.  Well, I saw one think that someone said about \"Show me a team that used Split- fires....\"  Well, here's some additional insight and some theories about splitfire plugs and how they boost us as oppossed to cages.  Splitfires were originally made to burn fuel more efficiently and increased power for the 4x4 cages.  Well, for these guys, splitfires increased performance by increasing TORQUE.  They weren't focusing on horsepower numbers.  Now how does this related to us high performance pilots?  Well, that depends.  Do you pilot a high performance 2- or 4-cylinder machine? In the case of 4-cylinders, splitfires would increase overall torque, but 4's make more top end horsepower with its torque packed down low. So for 4's, splitfires would not significantly increase power.  But what about twins?...  Many of you 4 guys laugh at some of us twins, but many times we carry less weight which sometimes can make up for the hp loss (see Doug Polen vs. Scott Russell, Daytona 1992).  However, twins make more torque thoughout their powerbands.   So how does this translate?  Increased torque should \"theoretically\" help twins make more power.  Splitfire claims that there should be not extra mods or anything made, just stick 'em in.  Now I don't know about all of this (and I'm trying to catch up with somebody about it now), but Splitfires should help twins more than 4's.          As far as racing teams....  Ducati team \"Fast by Ferraci\" used splitfires in the 1989 season (this is when they had Jamie James running for em), but I don't know why they stopped since then.

I do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with \"Kartagener's syndrome\", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic infections. \"Situs inversus\" means that organs are on the wrong side of the body, and can be complete or partial. It is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the \"normal\" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in absence of this, laterality can be \"random.\" People with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong side).   According to Harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected. But there may be much more current information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking about more than one conditiion.

The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a  contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a \"truth\" is not always \"true\" then we have a contradiction in terms.    Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, \"There are no absolutes\" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.  >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical  >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding  >Biblical interpretation.  So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.   --  Virgilio \"Dean\" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics    CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee     \"Bullwinkle, that man's intimidating a referee!\"   |    My boss is a     \"Not very well.

I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.

You're not playing with a full deck, are you?  Where would Turkey invade? Are you throwing the Cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header in hopes that the Greek netters will jump the gun?  Yes indeed Turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is  the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the negotiating table.  That's hard to do when Armenians are attacking Azeri  towns.  Armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the  futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that  leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's  going to cause incessant skirmishes.  Think of 10 or 20 years down the  line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  These people will be neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?  If you belong to the Armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes your fancy on the map is costing the local Armenians dearly in terms of their blood and future.  It's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize  craziness to have your feelings about Turks tickled.  The Armenians in Armenia and N-K will be there, with the same people you seem to hate  as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.

Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best. With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely  plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it intrinsically less believable than the government stories.  >>The FBI also said that the Davidians had a methanphetamine lab in their >>basement and that the Davidians had .50 cal machine guns. >> >>Do you believe everything the FBI says?   >Do you disbelieve everything the FBI says? >I balance my gut reaction to question authority together with the  >independent facts as I see them on video.

There's a pretty good article in the the March 6, 1993 New Scientist titled \"Pouring cold water on Lorenzo's oil\".  The article states that research has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  In patients with AMN (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).      If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).      The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.      Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.      Questions fall into three basic types:      1) Where do I find some information about space?      Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask     for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There     are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended     discussion.      2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?      Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been     thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for     evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.      3) Miscellanous queries.      These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of     FAQ postings.       SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE      Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.     Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]     Edit \"Subject:\" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.     Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth  100 posts).     Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST  not SPACE.     Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all  references.)     Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're  responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!     Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail  or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the  'reply' function of mailers will work.     Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone  will get on TV anyway.     Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:  keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals  (use carriage returns).

I am sick and tired of this 'DRIVING THE JEWS INTO THE SEA' sentance attributed    to Islamic movements and the PLO; it simply can't be proven as part of their    plan !     (Pro Israeli activists repeat it like parrots without checking its authenticity    since it was coined by Bnai Brith)     What Hamas and Islamic Jihad believe in, as far as I can get from the Arab media,    is an Islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under Koranic    Law. This would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the Jews in    Palestine took control of the land and its (mostly Muslim) inhabitants.     However, whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture, blowing up their    homes, murders,...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. The political    thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the    Jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.     As for the PLO, I am at a loss to explain what is going inside Arafat's mind.     Although their political thinking seems far fetched with Israel acting as a true    super-power in the region, the Islamic movements are using the same weapon the    Jews used to establish their state : Religion.      Ahmed.  Forget the syntax, Ahmed, and focus on the semnatics. The fact is that the PLO does not recognize Israel's right to exist. This is perfectly obvious from the PLO covenant (Cairo, 1968). The covenant calls for the destruction of the \"Zionist entity\". As far as I know the Israel-destruction clauses still exist in the document which specifies the purpose for the existence of the PLO. If you would like, I can post the relevant caluses.  Now the Hamas ideal is far more radical, it seems. I know it has been posted here several times, and while I do not have a copy of it, I am sure that someone does and he (or she, of course) would be more than happy to repost it.  Regardless of phrasing, groups like Hamas, and the Hezbollah, and even the newly moderate and politically-correct PLO, have at the very heart of their ideologies the need for the destrcution of Israel.  It just seems to me that Mr. Davidsson's suggestion that Jews support people envolved in these organizations is not a particularly appealing one to many Jews.  Harry.

It should be added that this technique of automatic substitutions into orders, i.e. the machine's ability to modify its own orders (under the control of other ones among its orders) is absolutely necessary for a flexible code. Thus, if part of the memory is used as a \"function table\", then \"looking up\" a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify, or rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which controls this \"looking up\", and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question.  On the other hand, this ability of the machine to modify its own orders is one of the things which makes coding the non-trivial operation which we have to view it as.\"  david cary, tenor, e- and comp. engineering (finger caryd@a.cs.okstate.edu). 227 S. 163 E.

I don't have to \"try reading a bit\", Pat.  I *work* as a government contractor and know what the rules are like.  Yes, they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant.

Did you ever read newspaper at all?   \"PAINFUL SEARCH ..\"  THE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians in the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the four-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.  The figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials and casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.  The 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control of Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations in Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the dead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first suppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku. Later  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken Azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000 dead.  The State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a 15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali Disaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on preliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman Memmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in the Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700 dead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman of the Azeri Ministry of Defence.  FranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International Red Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of Agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque from  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the bodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr Zen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags and products to wash the dead.\"  Mr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the number of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will take  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old lawyer said at his small office.  Mr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714 wounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist uprising in Baku in January 1990.  Those  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly what  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70 miles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.  Officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the republic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage of the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic scientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the chaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury our dead within 24 hours.\"  Of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14 years old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland snows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's report. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those believed to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.  Files  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still disorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far comes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27 February.  \"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to count properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream and the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr Manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter pilot.  \"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but Armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to return.\"  There  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages taken over by Armenian forces.  THE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92   HEROES WHO FOUGHT ON AMID THE BODIES  AREF  SADIKOV sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the Caspian Sea  esplanade of Baku and  showed a line of  stitches in his trousers, torn  by an Armenian bullet as he  fled the town of Hojali just over three months ago, writes Hugh Pope.  \"I'm still  wearing the same  clothes, I don't have  any others,\" the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the Hojali disaster. \"I was wounded in five places, but I am lucky to be alive.\"  Mr Sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12 days. They  sensed the  Armenian noose was tightening  around the 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling Azeri town  on the edge of Karabakh.  \"At about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy machine-guns, the lot,\" Mr Sadikov said.  Soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction of  the  attack. Some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the snow into a forest on the other side.  To escape, the  townspeople had to reach the Azeri  town of Agdam about 15  miles away. They  thought they  were going to  make it, until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two Armenian villages of Nakhchivanik and Saderak.  \"None of my group was hurt up to then ... Then we were spotted by a  car on  the road,  and the  Armenian outposts  started opening fire,\" Mr Sadikov said.  Azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of Hojali rushed forward to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts were mostly  in vain.  Mr Sadikov  said only  10 people  from his group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman son.  Seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his 67-year-old elder brother.  \"I only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,\" he said, pulling his own big  flat Turkish cap over his eyes. \"We have never got any of the bodies back.\"  The first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire. One hero  of the  evacuation, Alif  Hajief, was  shot dead  as he struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's crossing, Mr Sadikov said.  Another hero,  Elman Memmedov, the  mayor of Hojali, said  he and several others  spent the whole day  of 26 February in  the bushy hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three Armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.  As the  survivors staggered the  last mile into Agdam,  there was little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was soon to flee.  \"The night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big Armenian rocket attack. Some people just  kept going,\" Mr Sadikov said. \"I had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. I  was in a  bad way. They even found a bullet in my sock.\"  Victims of  war: An  Azeri woman  mourns her  son, killed  in the Hojali massacre in February  (left).

JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized image compression mechanism. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes. It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line drawings.  JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG respectively.  JPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are invisible to the eye.  A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.   [2]  Why use JPEG?  There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store 24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.  Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a 2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)  If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply.  It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.  The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel (16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.   [3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?  JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images, GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.  As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or gray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)  GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors, such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form. (In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they should be avoided in JPEG files.)  JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high. If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.  Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it. The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).  Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG. You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.  If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do. (Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself. If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not convert well.   [4]  How well does JPEG compress images?  Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG software described in section 6B.  File    Size in bytes  Comments  ship.ppm 1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits     or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead) ship.ppm.Z  963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress     compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.     Other text-oriented compressors give similar results. ship.gif  240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif     Most of the savings is the result of losing color     info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)  ship.jpg95  155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)     This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,     at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs. ship.jpg75   58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)     You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original, even with both on-screen at once. ship.jpg50   38406  cjpeg -Q 50     This has slight defects; if you know what to look     for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing     the original.  Still as good image quality as many     recent postings in Usenet pictures groups. ship.jpg25   25192  cjpeg -Q 25     JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent     at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).     Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this. ship.jpg5o    6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)     Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:     the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !  In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical ratio for real-world scenes.   [5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?  Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the information\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary; it's not a percentage of anything.  The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting (smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.  The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.  If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation. The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG. The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to 95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).  If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".  (Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just \"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)   [6]  Where can I get JPEG software?  Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP. If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\". (If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with \"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP List FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in the news.answers archive.  NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.   [6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:  The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.  X Windows:  John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first. But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG. CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.  Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package, also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z. This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software.  Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage, said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original. (The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4 decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.   MS-DOS:  This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.  One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files. The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca (129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is not flashy, but it's functional.  Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do). You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a bit tricky; read the directions carefully!  A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use --- more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip. Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver is missing.)  A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it. The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway. The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.  The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good: it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.  Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any* of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right thing with hi-color displays.)  The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.  Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF. These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version 2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip. NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is not readable on non-PC platforms.  Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images. A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.  NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20 runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document refers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means \"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives; most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files in (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA, consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.  Microsoft Windows:  There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images. (Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware, due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)  The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0 is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip. Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers. But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...  JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip. (Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites, including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)  WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files; it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter. It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow 286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version, which is roughly 25% faster.)  ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)  DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen mode, not in a window.  OS/2:  The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151). Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip     32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4. /pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip     16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip     Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.     Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip     PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows     (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20. /pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip     PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing     fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed     as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.  Macintosh:  Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed. To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx. (As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0 in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However, some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)  Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format. Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.  The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very well thought out.  GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later. GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.) Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.  JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx. This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing. You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.  Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.  Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx. Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime. Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display, and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)  Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter. This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.  If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance), GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.  More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version 2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.  Amiga:  (Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)  HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.  Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM, and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)  Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.  If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24 and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting, effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro), from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.  The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\", \"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion, anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.  Atari ST:  The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc, from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo. These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.  I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris, but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.  Acorn Archimedes:  !ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG, although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.  Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede, The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).  There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST, Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.   Portable software for almost any system:  If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program. If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa or PPM 24-bit image files.  There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case, purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.   [6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:  Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code, documentation, and some small test files is available from several places. The \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9 or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP. If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip. If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34. (If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)  The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats. The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.  We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use. Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products. We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details). We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.  The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.   [7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?  Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware. Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display 256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something of a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with the standard usage though.)  Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at the very lowest JPEG quality settings).  Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for *all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors. This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\" into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.  (Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see posted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster (a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF. JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)  On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to 256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.) For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to. This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image. Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization algorithm, you're out of luck.  For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware. JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was sent.  It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!  Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display hardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively. Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images in a machine-independent fashion.   [8]  How does JPEG work?  The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ. This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files /pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.   [9]  What about lossless JPEG?  There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.  Saying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image. What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say \"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)  Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye, but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.  At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees bit-for-bit accuracy.  If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with 6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.   [10]  Why all the argument about file formats?  Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms; it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations.  Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to \"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with anybody else's.  The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined two JPEG-based file formats:   * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports     pixels and not much else.   * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is     a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,     because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation. Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards.  I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common denominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.  A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand; see section 11 for details.  Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)   [11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?  If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:  1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,     followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.  2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a     \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---     it's worth a try, anyway.  3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI     software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they     won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.  4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off     everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.  5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are     lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.     If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),     try stripping off everything before that.  In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is   \"begin\" line  M_]C_X ...  whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with   \"begin\" line  M:'-I ...  If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non-JFIF files.   [12]  What about arithmetic coding?  The JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed. The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)  Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses from these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best.)  At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not* be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.  There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future.  Stay tuned for further details.   [13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?  It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially. Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the first time around.  The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.) One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.  In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation. (If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move. If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but that's a mighty limited capability!)  The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format (PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way :-).   [14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?  As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from, here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality.  The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF; that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)  Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation. Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file, not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).  Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this.)  cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher Q setting may not be necessary.)  Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store. If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it). To get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression. Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image than you'd get without smoothing.  With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing capability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs. Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is a LOT faster than pnmconvol...  The upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.   ---------------------  For more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in particular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.  --     tom lane    organizer, Independent JPEG Group Internet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu BITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie "],["rec.autos",6.0,6.0,"From: kastle@bernoulli.WPI.EDU (Jacques W Brouillette) Subject: Re: ARCTIC WHEELS AUTO SHOW Organization: Worcester Polytechnic Institute Lines: 5 NNTP-Posting-Host: bernoulli.wpi.edu  --   : I want only two things from this world, a 58 Plymouth and a small  :   : OPEC nation with which to fuel it.

This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court a few years ago.  While I was waiting my turn to state my case and plea of why I was going 75 in a 55 in my cage, I had the opportunity to listen to some of the \"creative excuses\" offered the judge by others.  After listening to a number of \"Well, I was passing a very slow truck that suddenly speed up\" versions, I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and then some.  He was less than impressed with any of them.  This young, rather burley looking guy, had his docket read by a rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper. He was clocked riding a motorcycle at a speed of 110 mph in a 55 mph zone.  It was also noted that the defendant (motorcycle rider) had alcohol on his breath, but was not cited for this offence.  The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice: \"Well son, those are some pretty fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle.  What do you have to say for your self?\"  \"Well Sir\", meekly the defenant replied, \"I just was over to my buddys and we had a couple of beers and I was on my way home.\" He offered nothing more or less.  Just had a couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home.  The judge moved by the simplicity of the response, fined him the maximum in this case (plus court costs of course) and ordered him to attend remedial drivers training school.

I live  in fear of what will happen when I  die.     I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.               I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.    <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.    Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are  because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  \"Oh wow..all i have to do is  follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness.\" For all of you \"found jeezus\" , how many of you were \"on the brink?\"  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.        Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.   It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a \"non-believer\", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696  who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.

The 27th was a short day at work, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided to go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal Flame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had walked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24 Volga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the  car. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit, and the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn't have anything on her head, and  her hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They're 40 to  45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help them. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?  When I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn't see what it was,  but it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the  Eternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle around it. I ask, \"What's going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well they were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother Muslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I didn't understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to  get a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter.  New people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And the comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There's no need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All  Moscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this  was no joke. I quietly left and went home.  Now before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh,  that there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of  things, but I didn't have any idea what was really going on.  My wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt's house in Baku.  I didn't say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two o'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and  shouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly, like they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a  demonstration and move slowly.  My wife asks what's going on out there. I say I don't know. I put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd people are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I waited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street  on the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned  and went against the traffic--it's one way there--down the Street of the 26  Baku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there  was a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same  kind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside  from the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.  My wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of uneasy and said, \"No, let's stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe  an hour and a half. Well, I wasn't keeping track of the time, I can't say exactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on the side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.  I put outside clothes on and went out again. There's noise, an uproar outside, and the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time  there were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more  aggressive. No, I think, something's wrong here, this isn't any demonstration. They would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run  again. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I  followed them. I was thinking I'd just watch and see. Who knew where this was  leading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one  side, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square  and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There  was some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals. I heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don't need  perestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they  mean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else.  But too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense  of others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just  in Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I've never seen it  anywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.  Now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians'  apartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn't  hear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and  drive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then another are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and  I think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB. There were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn't see any of them try  to pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.  Well I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no demonstration, and I had to protect my family.  I left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next to the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai- lor's shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some- thing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because after all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City  Party Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I  saw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the  cases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15  to 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried  off by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe  about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha.  When I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was  about a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He  has a package in his hand, and he's pulling out anasha and handing it out. I  have never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I've seen a lot of  people smoke it, I've seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled  around and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.  Before I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting.  I turned around and saw them running. Well I'll just keep on going like I am,  I thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags.  And I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the  street. He's a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag,  which had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to  Armenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don't really know what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father's name is Rafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark blue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His  family, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on  Narimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars;  their apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the  left. Now Rafik's little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a  new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son  was carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because  before this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being  done not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.  Well anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It's OK, it'll pass,  they're young kids, they've just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn't  want her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And  this time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn't  see where. Well I think, here we go, the machine's in motion. They weren't  handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn't see people drinking  and smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn't unloaded the vodka and  hashish to put in a store window!  So the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one  would stop them now, they weren't even trying, although, I'll say it again,  the police were there, I saw them. And it's not just that the police weren't  breaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time.  True, at the time I couldn't even imagine that under our government, our much- vaunted leadership--and I'm not afraid to say these words: so many people  died, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I  couldn't imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be  specific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of  Sumgait, I couldn't imagine that such things could take place.  When they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let's go upstairs.\"  We went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the  evening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more. I stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I  look and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to  the bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old.  The crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed  toward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person,  wheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as  though it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more  noise, and the glass was flying again.  We spent the night at the neighbors'. My apartment was on the first floor, there was really no way to defend yourself there.  In the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town.  On the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or  what happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the  bread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying  there hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing you couldn't even see him.  That was on the morning of February 28. Everyone knows the rest.

I don't know anyone with a bike who could  teach me, and the most advice I've heard is either \"do you live near a field\" or \"do you have a friend with a pickup truck\", the answers to both of which are NO.  Do I just ride around my neighborhood and hope for  the best?  I kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.

If Brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  This will prevent competitors from coming out with Clipper-compatible phones which lack the government- installed \"back door.\"  The strategy Brad describes will only work as long as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government chips.  (It would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if Brad turns out to be right.  As long as people still have the power to provide their own encryption in place of or in addition to the Clipper, privacy is still possible.

The HINT EISA DMA has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of ISA.  For this reason I would pass.  I own one of these (HAWK VL/EISA/ISA) and am look- ing to replace it for exactly this reason.  Please double-check me on this.  In other words, call the motherboard manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit EISA DMA.  Other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (I am using mine with DOS 5, Windows 3.1, and UNIX S5R3.2).

The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me a little of the Dodger logo.    Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional. (Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums construcrted throughout the sixties.

X X * Information from the ---author--- section will be published unless  X   'y' was given to the respective author's 'anon' line. X X * To credit multiple authors, include an ---author--- section for X   each author.  Each should start with ---author--- line, and X   should be found between the ---entry--- and ---build--- sections. X X * The entry's remarks should include: X     - what this program does X     - how to run the program (sample args or input) X     - special compile or execution instructions, if any X     - special filename requirements (see rule 4 and 5) X     - information about any ---data--- files X     - why you think the program is obfuscated X     - note if this entry is a re-submission of a previous entry. X     - any other remarks (humorous or otherwise) X X * Do not rot13 your entry's remarks.  You may suggest that certain X   portions of your remarks be rot13ed if your entry wins an award. X X        * Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  They  X   should not be required to exist. X X   If your entry does not need an info file, skip the ---info--- X   section.  If your entry needs multiple info files, use multiple  X   ---info--- sections, one per info file.  You should describe X   each info file in the ---remark--- section. X X    4) If your entry is selected as a winner, it will be modified as follows: X X    'build' is incorporated into a makefile, and 'build' is removed X    'prog.c' is renamed to your entry's title, followed by an optional X        digit, followed by '.c' X    your entry is compiled into a file with the name of your entry's X        title, possibly followed by a digit X X       If your entry requires that a build file exist, state so in your X       entry's remark section.  The makefile will be arranged to execute a X       build shell script containing the 'build' information.  The name of X       this build shell script will be your entry's title, possibly followed X       by a digit, followed by '.sh'. X X       If needed, your entry's remarks should indicate how your entry must X       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames. X X    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be X       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files, X       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this X       occurs, state so in your entry's remarks. X X    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected. X       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not  X       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    7) The program must be of original work.  All programs must be in the X       public domain.  All copyrighted programs will be rejected. X X    8) Entries must be received prior to 07-May-93 0:00 UTC.

X X    This is not the IOCCC rules, though it does contain comments about X    them.  The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions. X    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are X    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines. X X    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries. X    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines. X X XWHAT IS NEW IN 1993: X X    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c X    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT. X X    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C X    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers  X    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with  X    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor  X    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES. X X XHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: X X    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See X    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners. X X    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries X    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year X    might be 'old' the next year. X X    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply X    a number of tests to an entry: X X * look at the original source X * convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#include' lines X * C pre-process the source ignoring '#define' and '#include' lines X * run it through a C beautifier X * examine the algorithm X * lint it X * compile it X * execute it X X    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests. X    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been X    'cleaned up' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier. X X    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain X    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the X    'strangest/most creative source layout' need not do as well as X    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given X    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that X    does something interesting when you run it. X X    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave X    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life X    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request X    is important.  For this reason, we often award 'worst abuse of the X    rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way. X X    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know X    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse X    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the X    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to X    annoy more than amuse. X X    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries X    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award 'worst abuse of the rules' X    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use X    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-) X X    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make X    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly X    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some X    of the best entries fall down because they didn't work. X X    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that X    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off X    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power X    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes, X    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly X    working entry is best. X X XOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES: X X    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become 'old'.  We X    tend to 'see thru' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests X    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won't go as far X    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. X X    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we: X X #define d define X #d foo     <-- don't expect this to turn into #define foo X X int i; X j;     <-- don't use such implicit type declaration X int k; X X    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you  X    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in  X    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers. X X    Unfortunately, ANSI C requires array indexes to be of integral type. X    Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed: X X int i; X char *c; X i[c];     <--- use c[i] instead X (i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead X X    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of X    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety X    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are X    not portable and must not be used: X X * assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable X * casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable X * passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg X * passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg X * performing arithmetic on va_list variables X * using va_list as a structure or union X X    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **'s. X X    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead. X X    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...), X    the leading '#' must be the first character on a line.  While some X    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading '#', many do not. X X    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries X    must not assume that it returns an int. X X    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise. X    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do X    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people X    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for X    programs that are compact, and are instructional. X X    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80 X    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion. X X    We tend to dislike programs that: X X * are very hardware specific X * are very OS or Un*x version specific X      (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific X       code is likely not to be) X * dump core or have compiler warnings X      (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item) X * won't compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x X * abusing the build file to get around the size limit X * obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs X * are longer than they need to be X * are similar to previous winners X * are identical to previous losers  :-) X X    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the X    'best one liner' category, we suggest that you format your program X    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. X X    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size X    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D's to help out, X    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D's in order to X    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel X    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off X    if you show some amount of restraint. X X    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact X    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get X    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters. X X    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob X    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C X    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third X    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting X    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two! X X    We suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self-replicating' X    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim X    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating X    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating. X    You might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest', lest we (or others) X    know of a smaller one! X X    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that X    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don't X    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don't depend X    on color or a given size.  Don't require backing store. X X    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and X    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client X    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the X    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a). X    Don't use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone X    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not X    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or X    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better X    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems. X X    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on X    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines X    in the ---remark--- section. X X    We like programs that: X X * are as concise and small as they need to be X * do something at least quasi-interesting X * pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice) X * are portable X * are unique or novel in their obfuscation style X * MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION X * make us laugh and/or throw up  :-) X X    Some types of programs can't excel in some areas.  Of course, your X    program doesn't have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several X    areas really does help. X X    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in X    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to X    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two. X    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well. X X    Be creative! X X XENTRY FORMAT: X X    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your X    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format, X    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the X    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS) X X    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to X    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that X    is found in mkentry.c: X X This program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every X attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces X an entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases, X where this program differs from the contest rules, the X contest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the X contest rules before submitting an entry. X X    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however, X    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check X    the entry against the size rules. X X    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about X    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.  (see below) X X    The following is a sample entry: X X---entry--- Xrule: 1993 Xfix: n Xtitle: chonglab Xentry: 0 Xdate: Mon Mar  1 08:45:20 1993 Xhost: Un*x v6, pdp11/45 X 2.9BSD, pdp11/70 X---remark--- X    This is a non-obfuscated obfuscated C program.

If an entry wins, we will rename X    its source and binary to avoid filename collision.  By tradition, X    we use the name of the entry's title, followed by an optional X    digit in case of name conflicts. X X    If the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award, X    we would use chonglab.c and chonglab. X X    If your entry depends on, or requires that your build, source X    and/or binary files be a particular name, please say so in the X    ---remark--- section.  If this case applies, it would be be helpful X    if you did one of the following: X X * Tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry. X X * Have the build file make copies of the files.  For example: X X  cc prog.c -o special_name  need special binary X X     or  rm -f special_src.c   need special source X  cp prog.c special_src.c X  cc special_src.c -o special_name X X     or  rm -f special_build   need special build X  tail +4 build > special_build X  sh < special_build X X * Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of  X   your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You  X   should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections. X X    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files, X    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid X    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should X    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This X    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch. X X    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We X    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the X    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them X    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files, X    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed, X    then skip the ---info--- section. X X    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that X    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an X    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample X    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a X    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a X    'hints' file. X X    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For X    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed X    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental, X    the entry should not require them exist. X X    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name X    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason, X    say so in the ---remark--- section. X X    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they X    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say X    so in the ---remark--- section. X X    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has X    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should X    have entry number 0. X X    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry X    format may be ignored.  That is, don't place text outside of the X    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren't X    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the  X    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at: X X ...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges (not the address for X judges@toad.com      submitting entries) X     X    The date should be given with respect to UTC.  (Some systems refer  X    to this as GMT or GMT0)  The format of the date should be that as  X    returned by asctime() in the C locale.  An example of such a string is: X X Thr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993 X X    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The X    string does not include the timezone name before the year.  On many  X    systems, one of the following command will produce a similar string: X X date -u \"+%a %h %d %T 19%y\" X date -u | sed -e 's/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/' X sh -c 'TZ=UTC date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X sh -c 'TZ=GMT0 date | sed -e \"s/... \\(19[0-9][0-9]\\)$/\\1/\"' X X    You are allowed to update/fix/revise your entry.  To do so, set X    the 'fix' line in the ---entry--- section to 'y' instead of 'n'. X    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number X    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be X    replaced. X X XJUDGING PROCESS: X X    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll. X X    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message X    is unpacked into individual files, each containing: X X ---entry--- section X all ---author--- sections X all ---info--- sections X ---build--- section X ---program--- section X any other text, including the Email message headers X X    Prior to judging, the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure X    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was X    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the X    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is X    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award. X X    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular X    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are X    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding X    out in the end, who won and where they were from. X X    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award. X    Because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced, we make all X    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning X    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even X    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious, X    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC X    winners at talks) X X    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the X    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give X    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their X    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We X    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well. X    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world. X X    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round, X    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles; X    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does X    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the X    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings. X X    A reading consists of a number of actions: X X * reading the ---entry--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---build--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---program--- section X * reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any X * passing the source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X * performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source X * passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor X     shipping over any #include files X X    In later rounds, other actions are performed: X X * linting the source X * compiling/building the source X * running the program X * performing misc tests on the source and binary X X    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries X    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it X    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round. X    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form X    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards. X    An entry often will compete in several categories. X X    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries X    we receive.  A typical category list might be: X X * best small one line program X * best small program X * strangest/most creative source layout X * most useful obfuscated program X * best game that is obfuscated X * most creatively obfuscated program X * most deceptive C code X * best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES) X * best abuse of ANSI C X * worst abuse of the rules X * <anything else so strange that it deserves an award> X X    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so X    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round. X    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary. X X    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of X    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10 X    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into X    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not X    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is X    less clear cut. X X    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out X    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is X    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry  X    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,  X    that the entry is worth improving in the first place! X X    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a X    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest X    rules in some way. X X    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'.  Sometimes such X    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the X    'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories. X X XANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS: X X    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.  By tradition, X    this is done during the latter part of the UUNET/IOCCC BOF, just prior to X    the Berkeley BSD, and BSDI BOF. X X    Winning entries will be posted in late June to the following groups: X X     comp.lang.c    comp.unix.wizards alt.sources X X    In addition, pointers to these postings are posted to the following X X     comp.sources.d   alt.sources.d  misc.misc X     comp.sources.misc   comp.windows.x X X    Winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives.  See X    below for details. X X    Often, winning entries are published in selected magazines.  Winners  X    have appeared in books (\"The New Hackers Dictionary\") and on T-Shirts.

It was the Phils only win in the three game series, and was the first time the Phillies have lost a series in the young season.   The Phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2 John Kruk 2-run homers and two Wes Chamberlain homers.  However Danny Jackson, and the Phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead. Mitch Williams entered the game with the Phillies leading 8-4, however Candy Maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  In the 11th, Dave Hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year to push the Phils ahead to stay.  However, in a shaky bottom of the 11th the Cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when the Cubs pinch hit Randy Myers for Bob Scanlan (they were out of position players) and Myers bunted into a double play to end the game.

ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.  At the time Ezekiel was written, Israel was in apostacy again and if I'm not  mistaken, Tyre was about to make war on Israel.  Like I said, the Prince of  Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan  the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.  Don't think my interpretation is neccessarily the orthodox Christian one,  although most Christian Bible commentaries interpret the King of Tyre as  being a reference to Satan.

Bill, you are kidding yourself here. Firstly, motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the rider can do that. Secondly, it is the adhesion of the tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise??   >Mike, I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such a natural >affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was a total >waste of time for you (assuming your total \"training\" hasn't come from >simply from reading rec.motorcycles).

Formal training in this country (as far as I am aware) does not include countersteering theory.  I found out about countersteering about six years ago, from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. I didn't believe him at first when he said I steered my bike to the right to make it turn left, but I went out and analysed closely what I was doing, and realized he was  right! It's an interesting bit of knowledge, and I've had a lot of fun since then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as I was. But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster or better as a result, is absurd.  Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to be able to ride a bike properly and safely. But by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn. And that was my original point.  Mike "],["misc.forsale",12.0,12.0,"From: berger@chaos.cs.brandeis.edu (David Berger) Subject: 101 Keyboard wanted.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- *****   Andrew McVeigh "],["sci.med",5.0,5.0,"From: sheffner@encore.com (Steve Heffner) Subject: Hernia Organization: Encore Computer Corporation Nntp-Posting-Host: condor.encore.com Lines: 20  A bit more than a year ago, a hernia in my right groin was discovered.

Most of us aren't Jews, so we | aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in | Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to | Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this | debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but | keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles | concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians, | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.  1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that \"where no law is, there is no transgression.\"  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised \"what ever He says to do we will do.\"  That is why the new covenant is based on \"better promises\" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to \"put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts\" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough \"For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel\" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says \"if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.\"  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.  |  | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us, | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews, | we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected | from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the | same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this. |  | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments | into \"moral\" and \"ceremonial\".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to | the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to | everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except | for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship.  People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). |  | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin | and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer | binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior | should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still | useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While | we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at | self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral | guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc. | These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same | function as, and have largely the same content as, the \"moral law\" in | the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that | given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important. |  I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying \"I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?\"  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 \"Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.\"  \"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good\" (Rom. 7:12).  | In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of | tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's | resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early | Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish | Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but | that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then. | Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also | implies gatherings on that day. |  | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to | worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day | Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a | regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and | that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.  Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate \"lay by him in store\" with \"go to a worship service.\" |  | It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See | Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about | judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific | day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue | that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col | 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly | mentions Sabbath.)  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. |  | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word | \"Sabbath\".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish | day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the | day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It | distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship. | (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There | are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians | support \"blue laws\", both in secular law and church law, setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish | Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the | Lord's Day. |  Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who \"esteem all days alike\" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says \"and they gathered every Sunday for worship\".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.    Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that \"on the first day of every week\" simply means every time they gather for worship.    I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.  --clh] "],["misc.forsale",12.0,12.0,"From: geos56@Judy.UH.EDU Subject: WholeSale TV sets.

Tough question -- more dangerous than driving a car, and far more dangerous if you don't apply a modicum of intelligence to the  activity.  Basically, stupidity will get you hurt/killed a lot faster on a motorcycle than in a car.  But with care, it is not unreasonably dangerous.  Also, buying good protective clothing is helpful, that way if something does go wrong, you are likely to be less severely injured.  First thing, if possible take a (MSF) driver training course, this will get you started on the right foot -- they teach control of the vehicle and safe riding practices.  Second, buy protective gear.  At minimum a good helmet and a pair of leather gloves are a must.  A good sturdy  piece of footgear is also very helpful, though leather hiking boots, a pair of old army boots, or something similar works fine for this purpose as long as you make sure the laces stay  tied.  After those, a leather jacket and leather pants or chaps are nice as well; but these are also expensive items.  For the pants, many people consider a good pair of jeans to be reasonable, preferably recent and of a fairly heavy weight.  Similarly for a jacket, a good jean jacket is a reasonable compromise, though more people tend to have leather jackets around than pants.  Another thing to do is drop in on garage sales looking for a second-hand leather jacket.  Look for a fairly thick leather in these items.  Third don't do anything stupid -- don't ride after  drinking, even one drink can noticeably affect you judgement and balance; don't ride in the snow, or when conditions are such that black ice is likely; be very careful riding in the rain -- slow way down, take corners gingerly,  brake early and gently;  try not to ride if you are sick, tired, taking any medication with drowsiness warnings, or otherwise not in average shape.  With care, you should be ok.  >The next question I have is what bike would you recommend for >a first time rider.

If you are shorter/lighter than average, you might want to go as low as a 300-400 cc bike.  Possible models:  The Suzuki GS### series (eg. GS500, GS650, etc.).  These are generally inline 4 bikes, generally dependable except for a tendency to  weakness in the charging system.  (Stator and/or Regulator/Rectifier  problems.)  My first bike was a (about '82) GS650, it server me well.  The Honda Nighthawk series (this may also be known as the CB### series I think).  eg. Honda CB450, CB650, etc.  This is another series of standard motorcycles.  Also fairly dependable.  Kawasaki and Yamaha probably have similar bikes, but I don't know them as well.  For mid to late '80s models of the above, you should be able to buy the bike for under $2000, leaving you money for protective  clothing and insurance and licensing costs.

Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu> Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)   Folks,  Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent the following to the WSJ.  -----  Gun Stats & Mortal Risks  Preston K. Covey    Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~ 2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~     Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this:  What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful here.    The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not take the bus?     Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:   The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense (the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12 accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of homes unaccounted.   The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on six counts:   1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members, dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic, but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is criminological hogwash.   2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories -- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk.    3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43 times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself.  People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter.   4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County, including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press, 1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to ~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally disregard this issue.   5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases.  But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17, 1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the NEJM statistic.    6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America , Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?  Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the NEJM scare stat:    A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody.      Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation; what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic.  Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.  --  Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com "],["sci.space",7.0,7.0,"From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) Subject: Vandalizing the sky Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana Lines: 50  yamauchi@ces.cwru.edu (Brian Yamauchi) writes:  >enzo@research.canon.oz.au (Enzo Liguori) writes: >>WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC  >>1.

Center for Regional Studies Lines: 106   04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir  By NEJLA SAMMAKIA  Associated Press Writer     GUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have begun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner  of the Caucasus.  The region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former Soviet Union to fight for independence.  Lezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the conscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared war with Armenia.  They also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which were effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national borders that had been only lines on a map.  A rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and demand a separate \"Lezghistan\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.  Officials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six demonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures and began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of Lezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.  Visitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon after the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.  At the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to discuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a war they say is not theirs.  \"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth glinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have nothing to do with Armenia.\"  More than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.  Malik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals drafted in 1992 had served.  \"The police don't force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an uprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"  All the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but disagreed on how the protest came about.  Some said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was about to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.  Others said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the Lezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.  \"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about draft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.  \"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis,  the Russians.\"  In the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties, in what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep over the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.  By 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they came under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.  About half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.  \"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais Talibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar, included brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.  \"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily. But Baku won't listen to us.\"  Physically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other Azerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same  jobs and intermarrying to some degree.  But the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and Persian with strong guttural vowels.  Azerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest ethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary  school classes in their language.  Autonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from Azerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the  Talish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern Azerbaijan.     --  David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | \"How do we explain Turkish troops on S.D.P.A.

Funnily, the previous hidden wholesale tax that it replaces was never referred to as a tax (or, people never paid mind to it, thus the uproar when it was brought up front as the GST ---  one party has actually campaigned on hiding the tax again).  The stated intent of the Tories was to use the GST to write down our deficit.  Unfortunately, their legislation didn't include any mechanism for disbursing the collected funds in such a manner and the money is now sitting in escrow.  I don't know what is involved in releasing the funds, but one dilemna is that the Tories are not fiscal conservatives themselves though while taxing and spending, they've made moves to apply the breaks to a runaway locomotive by the end of this time --- the end of their second term (~9 years). While they do have chances of getting a third term, catching up in the polls to their more moderate/slightly leftish pro-business rivals, the Liberals (as in Euro/UK), the Tories' heir-apparent  for the leaders' mantle has been termed a clone of Hillary  Clinton ...  gld -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Je me souviens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Gary L.

First question: When will the LawEnforcmentField be transmitted, and how does the remote Clipper Chip handle it? Is it transmitted periodically in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? Does the phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever, or tries it to turn them into voice-output ?

They can be guaranteed to give the government line when it counts. In US history it has been the  socialists such as myself who have been persecuted.    Now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force lets try thinking.  In the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as a defense project. Therefore this is not a party matter at all. George Bush was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook  remember.  Secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. They simply \"ask\" their chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be \"nice\" boys. After all Bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.  Thirdly the people who consider the Democrats to be socialist are not the same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. People might know this if the US education system did not suffer from the Mcarthyite and  Dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show  trials. Ever seen Ed Meese pissed?

Reply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic) Distribution: world News-Software: FSUUCP 1.2 R4 Lines: 111        Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion  of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical  documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs,  was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors,  program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and  radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide  of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people  of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the  lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is  mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their  lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations  may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and  prosperously.  ------------------------- letter ----------------------------------  During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which  not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the  method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day,  Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order  to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland,  which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia  continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:  1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility.  2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism  Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish  Genocide.  3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to  silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.  4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.  Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government  is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.  Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its  terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks  to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically  exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on  this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of  governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition  of the Turkish Genocide.  With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims of the Turkish Genocide demand:  1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian  Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;  2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and Kurdish people;  3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for  their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;  4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;  5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it  has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially  recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be  supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;  6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact  of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of  2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.  The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first  genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new  generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the  armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in  the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.   Serdar Argic                             'We closed the roads and mountain passes that                              might serve as ways of escape for the Turks                              and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using.

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.  I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved. I also think that this will not happen, as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind, too.

The last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of soc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as Josh McDowell and C.S. Lewis. The above also expresses a rather odd sense of history. What makes you think the masses in Aquinas' day, who were mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people today? If writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. If everyone in the medieval period \"knew the rules\" it was a matter of uncritically accepting what they were told.  Bill Mayne  [This may be unfair to Lewis.

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a \"fun\" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected. It discriminates against the poor.         Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened.)  >The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or >records of SERIOUS mental diseases.         This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals contain a sort of \"gotcha\" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even if you qualify in every way.  >Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun >-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun. >It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ??? >You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...         At this point, it should be pointed out that in general a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke.          But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance, which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public property, but in restricting activity on private property.                >Use of guns in crimes (in Norway): >Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms' >for a long time, but these are rather the exeption. >Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short  >time befor the crime. > >Use of knives: >It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'. >You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open >in public -rigth ??          This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions, where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in Europe to another).          Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can be either a state or local restriciton.         >Individual vs masses: >Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some >extent.... >Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ?? >What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of  >all the others ??         The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within this group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting  the rights of some other group.           If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you'd have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group \"people who own guns\" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one.  >The issue: >I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.         The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.  >We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one.... >IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME. >But should it have to be like that ??         Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us. But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.  >Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??         No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state may enforce it's \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be \"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.     >If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think >it should be free to buy guns ??         I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.         But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ David Veal Univ. of Tenn. Div. of Cont. Education Info.

The initiative will involve the creation of new products to    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.     For too long there has been little or no dialogue between our    private sector and the law enforcement community to resolve the    tension between economic vitality and the real challenges of    protecting Americans.  Rather than use technology to accommodate    the sometimes competing interests of economic growth, privacy and    law enforcement, previous policies have pitted government against    industry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.     Sophisticated encryption technology has been used for years to    protect electronic funds transfer.  It is now being used to    protect electronic mail and computer files.  While encryption    technology can help Americans protect business secrets and the    unauthorized release of personal information, it also can be used    by terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.     A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has    been developed by government engineers.  The chip represents a    new approach to encryption technology.  It can be used in new,    relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to    an ordinary telephone.  It scrambles telephone communications    using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in    commercial use today.     This new technology will help companies protect proprietary    information, protect the privacy of personal phone conversations    and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted    electronically.  At the same time this technology preserves the    ability of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to    intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.      A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the    \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding    Americans.  Each device containing the chip will have two unique          2      \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government    agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  When the    device is manufactured, the two keys will be deposited separately    in two \"key-escrow\" data bases that will be established by the    Attorney General.  Access to these keys will be limited to    government officials with legal authorization to conduct a    wiretap.     The \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with no    new authorities to access the content of the private    conversations of Americans.     To demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, the    Attorney General will soon purchase several thousand of the new    devices.  In addition, respected experts from outside the    government will be offered access to the confidential details of    the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report    their findings.     The chip is an important step in addressing the problem of    encryption's dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect the    privacy of individuals and industry, but it also can shield    criminals and terrorists.  We need the \"Clipper Chip\" and other    approaches that can both provide law-abiding citizens with access    to the encryption they need and prevent criminals from using it    to hide their illegal activities.  In order to assess technology    trends and explore new approaches (like the key-escrow system),    the President has directed government agencies to develop a    comprehensive policy on encryption that accommodates:   --   the privacy of our citizens, including the need to       employ voice or data encryption for business purposes;   --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone       calls and data, under proper court or other legal       order, when necessary to protect our citizens;   --   the effective and timely use of the most modern       technology to build the National Information       Infrastructure needed to promote economic growth and       the competitiveness of American industry in the global       marketplace; and    --   the need of U.S. companies to manufacture and export       high technology products.     The President has directed early and frequent consultations with    affected industries, the Congress and groups that advocate the    privacy rights of individuals as policy options are developed.           3     The Administration is committed to working with the private    sector to spur the development of a National Information    Infrastructure which will use new telecommunications and computer    technologies to give Americans unprecedented access to    information.  This infrastructure of high-speed networks    (\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, HDTV    programming, and huge data files as easily as today's telephone    system transmits voice.     Since encryption technology will play an increasingly important    role in that infrastructure, the Federal Government must act    quickly to develop consistent, comprehensive policies regarding    its use.  The Administration is committed to policies that    protect all Americans' right to privacy while also protecting    them from those who break the law.     Further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet.     The provisions of the President's directive to acquire the new    encryption technology are also available.

A:   No.  \"Clipper Chip\" technology provides law enforcement with  no new authorities to access the content of the private  conversations of Americans.     Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on  a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation  encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to  decipher the message?     A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a  court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.  They  would then present documentation of this authorization to  the two entities responsible for safeguarding the keys and  obtain the keys for the device being used by the drug  smugglers.  The key is split into two parts, which are  stored separately in order to ensure the security of the key  escrow system.     Q:   Who will run the key-escrow data banks?     A:   The two key-escrow data banks will be run by two independent  entities.  At this point, the Department of Justice and the  Administration have yet to determine which agencies will  oversee the key-escrow data banks.     Q:   How strong is the security in the device?  How can I be sure  how strong the security is?       A:   This system is more secure than many other voice encryption  systems readily available today.  While the algorithm will  remain classified to protect the security of the key escrow  system, we are willing to invite an independent panel of  cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assure all  potential users that there are no unrecognized  vulnerabilities.     Q:   Whose decision was it to propose this product?     A:   The National Security Council, the Justice Department, the  Commerce Department, and other key agencies were involved in  this decision.  This approach has been endorsed by the  President, the Vice President, and appropriate Cabinet  officials.     Q:   Who was consulted?  The Congress?  Industry?     A:   We have on-going discussions with Congress and industry on  encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify  as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  We have  briefed members of Congress and industry leaders on the  decisions related to this initiative.     Q:   Will the government provide the hardware to manufacturers?     A:   The government designed and developed the key access  encryption microcircuits, but it is not providing the  microcircuits to product manufacturers.  Product  manufacturers can acquire the microcircuits from the chip  manufacturer that produces them.     Q:   Who provides the \"Clipper Chip\"?     A:   Mykotronx programs it at their facility in Torrance,  California, and will sell the chip to encryption device  manufacturers.  The programming function could be licensed  to other vendors in the future.     Q:   How do I buy one of these encryption devices?      A:   We expect several manufacturers to consider incorporating  the \"Clipper Chip\" into their devices.     Q:   If the Administration were unable to find a technological  solution like the one proposed, would the Administration be  willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more  powerful encryption devices?     A:   This is a fundamental policy question which will be  considered during the broad policy review.  The key escrow  mechanism will provide Americans with an encryption product  that is more secure, more convenient, and less expensive  than others readily available today, but it is just one  piece of what must be the comprehensive approach to  encryption technology, which the Administration is  developing.   The Administration is not saying, \"since encryption  threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,  we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have  effectively done); nor is the U.S. saying that \"every  American, as a matter of right, is entitled to an  unbreakable commercial encryption product.\"  There is a  false \"tension\" created in the assessment that this issue is  an \"either-or\" proposition.  Rather, both concerns can be,  and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,  balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"Clipper  Chip\" and similar encryption techniques.     Q:   What does this decision indicate about how the Clinton  Administration's policy toward encryption will differ from  that of the Bush Administration?       A:   It indicates that we understand the importance of encryption  technology in telecommunications and computing and are  committed to working with industry and public-interest  groups to find innovative ways to protect Americans'  privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensure that law  enforcement agencies have the tools they need to fight crime  and terrorism.     Q:   Will the devices be exportable?  Will other devices that use  the government hardware?     A:   Voice encryption devices are subject to export control  requirements.  Case-by-case review for each export is  required to ensure appropriate use of these devices.  The  same is true for other encryption devices.  One of the  attractions of this technology is the protection it can give  to U.S. companies operating at home and abroad.

The US has been running on debt for  the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases.  And after the Gulf War, Israel could do whatever it wanted after not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged, but by no means forced, to negotiate.  Mr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a  nutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile, and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it  were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by Israel.  But that is not what Israel wants.

This probably only tells you that the DC blocking capacitor that's in series between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.  > any Ideas?   Open it up and look for the power amp \"ICs\".  They'll be fairly obvious.

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing.    --- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA Internet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055 "],["soc.religion.christian",1.0,1.0,"From: atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu (Cardinal Ximenez) Subject: Re: Ancient Books Organization: National Association for the Disorganized Lines: 20  cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (Mike Cobb) writes:  >If I talk with an atheist and tell him the New Testament is an historically  >reliable document, what reasons would I give him?    I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into  misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.   I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of  Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.  I could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who were led to Christianity by argument?

For example, is this a public key system or a private key system? If the latter, then I don't see how the system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and not the person).  Further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks. I would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic. I'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system, but it does make you think. Of course, this is easily fixable by  giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the  real 80-bit key.

I was diagnosed last May w/Crohn's of the terminal ileum. When I got out of the hospital I read up on it a bit, and came across several studies investigating the role of EPA (an essentially FA) in reducing inflammation. The evidence was mixed. [Many of these studies are discussed in \"Inflammatory Bowel Disease,\" MacDermott, Stenson. 1992.]  But if I recall correctly, there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies (both the ones w/pos. and w/neg. results). In the studies patients were given EPA (a few grams/day for most of the studies), but, if I recall correctly, there was no restriction of the _other_ FAs that the patients could consume. From the informed layperson's perspective, this seems mistaken. If lots of n-6 FAs are consumed along with the EPA, then the ratio of \"bad\" prostanoid products to \"good\" prostanoid products could still be fairly \"bad.\" Isn't this ratio the issue?  What's the view of the gastro. community on EPA these days? EPA supplements, along with a fairly severe restriction of other FAs appear to have helped me significantly (though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat I eat -- 8-10% calories).  -Brian <bmdelane@midway.uchicago.edu>  "],["rec.autos",6.0,6.0,"From: toml@miles.ca.boeing.com (Tom Locke) Subject: $22600 Subaru SVX -  Good deal?

We've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in picking up individual monitors. Their engineering tolerances are slack enough that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. Even where they overlap, you can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can lock in on one and average the others out.  The signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts of interactions with the building.

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41     Organization: NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center Lines: 32  I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isles wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles. Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick  scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!  As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck  towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or  committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!  As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps. Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli??

Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to      differing interpretations of \"create,\" and say that many Christians may      not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith      on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

In order to reply to the issue, you have to address      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the      conclusion that you grant.       The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus      is the creator of all.

The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is      nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible      says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:            The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the            kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];           (Matthew 13:38)            I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which            ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)            Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not            born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said            unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I            proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he            sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye            cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the            lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the            beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in            him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a            liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)            And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of            the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease            to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)            Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this            world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit            that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)            In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the            devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he            that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)       One becomes a child of God...            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the           sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)            Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that           we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us           not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he           is. (1 John 3:1-2)       ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of           the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)            Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus           Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,           (Ephesians 1:5)            Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)            For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of           God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;           but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,           Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we           are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)            Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one           that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)            Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is           begotten of him.

Whose \"Jesus of the Bible\" do you mean?       This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but       rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read       something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For       example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ       does not alter what the Bible teaches [ \"Looking for that blessed hope,      and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus      Christ;\" (Titus 2:13),\"Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus      Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through      the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:\" (2 Peter 1:1)]       on the Deity of Christ.       We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not       even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that       have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches,       you have to look at the Bible.  ra> >     \"Our Lord's mortality was essential to his own salvation\" (_The ra> >     Promised Messiah_, p. 456), \"He had to work out his own salvation by ra> >     doing the will of the Father in all things\" (ibid., p.54), \"he had ra> >     to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom\" (_Mormon ra> >     Doctrine_, p.71). ra> ra>    Welcome to the wonderful world of Mormon paradoctrine, Robert.

The curious part is that no one addressed the      issue of `Jesus needing to be saved.' Rick comes the closest with his \"I      have my own conclusions\" to addressing the point.       Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of      Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't      think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the      issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this      subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may       certainly be.   ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu "],["comp.graphics",13.0,13.0,"From: jejones@microware.com (James Jones) Subject: Re: Rumours about 3DO ???

Koberg,   Just a couple of minor corrections here...   1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.   2)  I'm not sure what you mean by \"signifying believers\"  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian.  The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is \"Baptized in the Holy Spirit\"  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about \"these signs following them that believe\" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't \"saved\".   3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do \"Neo-Pentecostals\" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message?  I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.

I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment      before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation,  \"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.  No time now to think of ....... religion,\"  Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said,  \"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.    As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to \"outer darkness.\".    Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\"  Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"    Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire.  Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah.  Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God.  The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.    How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?  Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about.  When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer darkness.\"    Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\" -away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.    No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an \"awesome\" thought.    \"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.    \"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.    In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\"  Of course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.\"   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal judgment.    A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going to be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.    I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others.  Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.\"  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever wont's.\"    \"Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.\" \"There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.\" --Rex   "],["comp.os.ms-windows.misc",9.0,9.0,"From: ramirez@IASTATE.EDU (Richard G Ramirez) Subject: Re: SUMMARY: Borland/Microsoft Database C Libraries Reply-To: ramirez@IASTATE.EDU (Richard G Ramirez) Organization: Iowa State University Lines: 4  Could you post a description of ObjectBase, your chosen product.

It states that:        >Israel will remain the existing source of authority until \"final status\"     is agreed upon;    >Israel will negiotiate the delegation of power to the organs of the      Interim Self-Government Arrangements (ISGA);    >The ISGA will apply to the \"Palestinian inhabitants of the territories\"     under Israeli military administration.

Several question do come to mind concerning the \"success\" we all hope for  in the ongoing negotiation process. These arrangements certainly seem to  be essentially a rejection of any Palestinian \"interim\" self-control.  Without exposing itself to unwarranted risks and creating irresversible  vulnerability, can Israel reasonably put forward (at later points in the  negotiating process) more \"relaxed\" proposals for this\"interim\" period?  How should proposals (from either side) be altered to temper their  \"maximalist\" approaches as stated above?

I bought a Viewsonic 17 for use at home but after a week I took it back.  I  felt for the money my NEC 5FG that I use at work was a much better monitor. The NEC is sharper, flatter, less distorted, and more stable.  I have heard  complaints from people about the NEC FG series having some quality control  problems but mine has been in use for about a year with no problems at all.  There was nothing really broken with the Viewsonic but overall it did not  match up.  I used my ATI Graphics Ultra in setup mode to push the  frequencies to their limits and the Viewsonic exhibited some problems that  the NEC did not.  I personally like the non-etched NEC with the OCLI filter  and the tube on the 17 was not as nice.  The 17 had some uncorrectable  pincusion and edge distortion problems.  Also, it would change brightness  when I switched modes and I was constantly having to fiddle with the  controls.  And the yoke was crooked and I had no way to compensate for the  raster that tilted downhill.  On the postive side, although not as handsome  as the NEC, the 17 had a smaller footprint and was not as heavy.  I have heard that Panasonic owns Viewsonic and the model 17 is being sold  through OEM channels with a Panasonic label on it.  If it's available that  way at a lower cost I could get more serious about it.  For now the NEC has  my vote but I'm searching for one of the new, cheaper, NEC 5FGe's to see if  it's just as good as its older brother the 5FG before I decide which one to  buy.  I have no experience with the Nanao.  I can never keep the Nanao models  straight and don't have any place I can walk in to get a good comparison of  all models.  --   Standard employer disclaimers apply    --  Keith W.

Article-I.D.: hydra.91513 Distribution: usa Organization: Georgia Institute of Technology Lines: 39  Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.  I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good  as it got for him.  Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)  Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.  FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65    = just over $1,000,000.  Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.  FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65    = almost 2,000,000.  (I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).  These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly  overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and  average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t  think I'm off by much.

For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.

The guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  He confirmed it was mint.     As for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  I bought my '90 with 12k miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800. There is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.

A VFR is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all.  One thing to look for, BTW, is a soft front end.  If my VFR is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot. Progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.

EDT                  Q   Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed?                  MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we  put out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national  police organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to  10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At  11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on  his way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At  12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval  Office.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations. Then from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the  various groups.              Q   A photo op with Vessey?              MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.              Q   Why?              MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.                Q   What about the lunch?              MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.              Q   Is he meeting with any congress people today?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.              Q   There are no meetings --              MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today,  no.              Q   Has the President been given any information by the  Pentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report  from Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the  Vietnamese on that subject?              MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order  of business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll  discuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the  parameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't  drawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's  something that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese  about first.              Q   Did the President talk with any Republican senators  yesterday about the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.              Q   How many times?              MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last  night.              Q   What was the outcome of that?              MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind  of an agreement on a jobs package.              Q   Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any  way flexible on this?              MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going  to get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll  continue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some  kind of an agreement.              Q   Did they discuss the VAT tax?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.              Q   Can you check that?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.        Q   So what are they -- is the President offering to  scale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down  to where Dole will sign on?              MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it  as he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs  package through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as  we reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the  moment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress  including, obviously, Senator Dole.              Q   Is he talking to anybody else?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other  Republicans yesterday.              Q   Is he talking to anybody today?              MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I  wouldn't rule it out.              Q   We were led to believe that the President called  Mr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the  conversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?              MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several  people on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the  stimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation  he would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the  conversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business,  but it was both.              Q   In the President's mind, are they linked  politically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the  stimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to  the American people?  Has he made that argument?              MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what  arguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed  to both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people  first.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional  Russian aid last night in Tokyo.              Q   But does the President believe that the stimulus  package will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for  Russian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?              MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to  continue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs  package, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs  package through the Congress.              Q   Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating  now with Dole?              MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.              Q   On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over  the break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they  had earlier for the package, the stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the  Senate for the jobs package.              Q   But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other  than Shelby?              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a  vote.              Q   What about Kohl?              Q   Kohl and Feingold?              MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll  continue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to  bring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of  the members of the United States Senate support the package.              Q   If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold,  why did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?              MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of  projects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose  funding if this jobs package doesn't pass.              Q   No Democrats.  (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.              Q   Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any  other Republicans again today?              MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but  again, I wouldn't rule it out.              Q   Does he plan to put out any more press releases to  any other states today?              MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of  breaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I  think it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those  up, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest  how their states would benefit from this package.              Q   Will you share those with us?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.              Q   Do you have copies of the ones you sent --              MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And  we certainly can continue to provide them today.              Q   Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent  stories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has  been given?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think  the President commented on it this morning to say only that it was  something he knew was being considered by the task force and that he  has not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add  to that.              Q   But he also said that business and labor groups are  telling him they support it.  Can you tell us --              MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going  to speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that  there has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't  think he said he was directly contacted by them.              Q   Are we to take that to mean that the administration  has sounded out business and labor groups on this --              MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public  discourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think  I want to add to that.              Q   In February, though, the President said that this  was something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What  has happened between then and now to cause this administration to  change its mind?              MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is  something that the working groups are looking at.  They're  considering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to  specific options that will be covered by the President's health care  plan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision  on it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.              Q   You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being  considered by anyone in the White House after the President's  comments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.              Q   And then suddenly --              Q   What happened?        MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said  throughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options  across-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about  and that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added  tax.        Q   But the President himself took this off the table,  Dee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility  of this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?        MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it  hasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are  looking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and  no decisions have been made.        Q   And it raises the question of how independently the  task force is working.        MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider  all options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're  considering all options.        Q   But that's not the impression that the President  left in February.  The impression he left was that this was something  that was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The  clear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was  not on the table, not an option.         Q   \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"              Q   Bring him on.        Q   And you repeatedly referred to the President's  remarks, telling us that those were still in operation.              MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)              Q   But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna  Shalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an  orchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers  --        MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a  Cabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not  orchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last  couple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We  confirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.        Q   Is it because he has very few options?        Q   Is this something that it will be incumbent upon  the task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has  the President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the  task force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in  fact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with  the President?          MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at  this point to convince the President of anything.  It is their  mission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and  the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I  think that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that  context, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been  made, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a  decision on.        Q   They will present it to him as one of his options,  though he specifically ruled it out?        MS. MYERS:  Correct.        Q   Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is  this a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to  this form of taxation?        MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The  working groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number  of issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that  they're looking at is the VAT.         Q   Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining  this possibility, was this on the table during the same time period  that you were telling us that it was not?        MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of  their drafting of options is.  I don't know.        Q   Who was telling you that it was not under  consideration?        MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's  comments.        Q   Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise  enough money to fund the core benefit package?        MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made  on how to pay for the health care plan.              Q   I'm asking whether the projections --              MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how  the plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going  to cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so  you can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out  until you know.        Q   Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer  models on a number of possible packages.        MS. MYERS:  Correct.          Q   The question is whether they have now determined  whether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest  minimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.        MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're  not going to answer until -- there's a number of options being  considered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact  details of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for  them are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.                Q   And when the President has been meeting with health  care -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing  --              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q      they have never once said to him, these are your  funding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT  in his --              MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific  nature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular  briefings.              Q   Well, you have.              MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not  considered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.              Q   No, but you said that it has not been presented to  him as an option.              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of  what's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.              Q      specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't  looked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of  paying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?   Because back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it  works, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --              MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if  you go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical  discussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were  generally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly,  it's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean,  that was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process  of the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.   It's something that the working groups will present to him among the  number of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not  going to comment any further on the details of the meetings where  health care issues are being discussed.              Q   It's your statement from this podium that no  discussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that  the option has not been presented to him.              MS. MYERS:  That is correct.              Q   Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand  by George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?              MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have  nothing to add to what's already been said.              Q   Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin  said yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or  considered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made  so that it would be less regressive?              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what  might happen if.              Q   But do you stand by the previous conversations in  February that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said  you'd exclude food and energy --              MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific  structure of a decision that hasn't been made.              Q   Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's  comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working  groups?              MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --              Q   Could you check for us, because that's a real  important credibility question?              MS. MYERS:  Sure.              Q   Since the task force was brought together this  issue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one  fairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in  the dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month  and a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be  considered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?              MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.   It is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has  not made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to  add.              Q   Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of  questions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem  with credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if  you all were not told at all that this thing was being considered  while you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if  it's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading  us.              MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come  out here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.              Q   Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to  indicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --              MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or  deliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about  this issue.              Q   All we were trying to find out --              MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out  and I've given you the answers, Helen.              Q   We're trying to find out what changed -- what made  it an option again.  That's the --              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.                Q   Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you  investigate it if the President has taken it off the table?              MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously  considering and the President has not made a decision on.              Q   Yes, but he took it off the table in February.              MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll  present it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.              Q   Why would they consider it if he has taken it off  the table?              MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table.               Q   Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change  his mind?              MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.              Q   Did he change his mind?              MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a  decision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's  something that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on  this we'll let you know.              Q   So he must have changed his mind, right?              MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean,  --              Q   Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he  changed his mind or the working groups think they're authority  exceeds the President's.              MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad  mandate to look at all options; they've done that.              Q   Are you going to put out his income tax?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on  his income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be  available.               Q   Will there be any kind of briefing to go through  it?              MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will  be available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you  through the questions.              Q   We're used to be walked line-by-line through the  presidential tax forms.              MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)              Q   Could we have one?              MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of  a formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer  your questions about it.              Q   Did they file a joint form?              MS. MYERS:  Yes.              Q   When did he file it?              MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.              Q   Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for  Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the  meeting.              Q   No backgrounder today?              MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.              Q   This is complicated stuff.  We need help.   (Laughter.)              MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in  one day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)              Q   Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of  force in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it  out, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your  thinking on whether or not to change your approach?              MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards  Bosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --              Q   But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they  people whose opinions would carry weight with you?              MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight  certainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've  initiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia,  although we're considering a number of options right now.  If the  Serbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on  to some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options,  which we've been saying regularly.              Q   One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a  straight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not  set a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or  tactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?              MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them  every day.              Q   Which doesn't work so --              MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.   We're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we  support the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on  the 26th.                Q   You say it's having an effect -- can you give us  any documentation?              MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to  you about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.              Q   There's been no -- you have not been able to  provide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any  effect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.              MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia  and we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be  happy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if  you'd like.              Q   We would like to hear from someone who can show us  what the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of  the terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't  seen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you  provide something along those lines?              MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.              Q   On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced  this morning -- where is that money coming from?              MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the  details of that package.              Q   So that would be new money that you would hope to  get?              MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the  $1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have  seen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in  Tokyo by Secretary Christopher.              Q   Isn't there a concern, though, about offering  something which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the  concern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.              MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do  something immediately, which required money that was already approved  in the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit  longer-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we  announced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional  approval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to  work with Congress to make that happen.              Q   To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of  conversations with members and will continue to work with them as  this process moves forward.              Q   Was Christopher able to put this package out with a  fair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through  Congress?              MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with  Congress.              Q   In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is  that -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?              MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and  the law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs  package.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help  give kids something to do.              Q   Who are they?              MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three  organizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police  Organizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police  Organizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union  of Police Associations.              Q   Will the FBI chief be there?              MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.              Q   Or any other federal law enforcement officials?              MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these  national law enforcement organization leaders.              Q   Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the  $400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?              MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.              Q   So this would be the $700 million that's in the  budget already, plus another $1.1 billion?              MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700  million already in the budget.              Q   Is this going to be part of the supplemental or  Fiscal '94 --              MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact  funding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.              Q   This $1.8 billion on top of --              MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400  million Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.              Q   And this is what prompted the President to call Bob  Dole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was  calling Bob Dole?              MS. MYERS:  Correct.              Q   Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?              MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting  with Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.              Q   Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some  Republicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are  complaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House  and the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the  other night, the satellite and all of this relationship. Does the White House feel that you're getting too close to these  Chambers of Commerce?              MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)   After how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any  attention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of  being too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled  by the support we've received from the national Chamber and local  Chambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on  this and other initiatives.              Q   What's the status of the President thinking about  going to this Democratic retreat?              MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost  certainly go.              Q   All three days?              MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be  there yet.                Q   Is it open to coverage?              MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.              Q   Is he going to have any kind of address, statement,  anything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?              MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't  made a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or  what --              Q   Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?              MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it  out.              Q   What about an AIDS czar?              MS. MYERS:  It's coming.              Q   Anything on the weekend?              Q   There's been a suggestion that he's going to this  retreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear  or have any involvement in the gay rights march.              MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been  discussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic  retreat.              Q   The weekend?              MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on  right now is the radio address on Saturday.              Q   Any travel plans?              MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.              Q   He's not going to be off campaigning for his  stimulus package?              MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.              Q   What about mid-week?  Anything likely?              MS.

Daevid Bornhuetter-Machen, The Madison Edge  \"The main difference between Adolf Hitler and Rush Limbaugh is that  Hitler was original and showed initiative.\"  --Mort Sahl on The Tom Snyder Radio Show, ABC Radio Network,  October 27, 1992.  (NLNS)--Believe it or not, I was planning this comparative review of  Mein Kampf and Limbaugh's transcribed rant, The Way Things Ought to  Be before Sahl issued his comparative review. As usual, Sahl's was  independent and sharp as a scalpel.  My effort can only dream of comparing favorably to Mort's. At  least it has a fairly popular orginating premise; everyone I'd mention the  idea to thought it was either divinely inspired or at least past due for  delivery.  Those reactions are based on parallels that should be obvious to the  most peripheral observer of the Acts of those False Prophets. Both are  noted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with  passion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in  fact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost  identical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German  election). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and  enthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their  ideological quilt.  The last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening  pages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the  German nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway  line between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923)  was \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when  there has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.  In fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as  the Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost  succeeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic  claim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement  ceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of  course, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of  God against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is  too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.  Of course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books,  my main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern  American Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version  of Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925),  and trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen  million followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book  after building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in  Weimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.  Thus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily  three-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary  propoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way  Things Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a  translation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the  printed word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since  radio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of  luxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to  spend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop  $22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.  But, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some  cloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of  their propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these  days.)  Mort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf  Hess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of  ABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio  program's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk  show, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He  knows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows  that Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the  opportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh  earns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a  RICO indictment.  On questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of  material in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For  example:  On Their Own Qualifications to Control Society  Hitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who  individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly  perhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in  order to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of  imagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight  for their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of  thought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\"  (page 577).  Limbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The  show is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my  brain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental  aptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree  with me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media  will slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking  and screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)  On Religion as the Basis of a Nation  Hitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are  inseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his  decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without  culture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord  sins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the  expulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)  Limbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ...  But our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or  ambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a  charming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools  for the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of  American education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)  On Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse  Hitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ...  One has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and  theatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ...  Theatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays  must be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the  service of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)  Limbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that  Hollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people  who believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality  and monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)  On the News Meida  Hitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of  gravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass  by in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the  people's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of  slavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)  Limbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the  bandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been  replaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During  the Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global  network. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't  realize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that  therefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided  and, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)  *     *     *   To continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but  ultimately too depressing to take in one reading.  After putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that  haunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened  Germans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed  Germans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s,  Rush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to  depressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American  radical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the  Reagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for  The Fascist States of America.  And if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the  radical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only  wonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.

After a while we got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone - electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus.    But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a  lot of them got \"funny\" in the LCD display.  A black stain would spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone).    What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway.

This message is a summary of the responses. Thanks to all of you that replied.   > 1) The card does not work in a system with 32M RAM.  a) The higher memory limits apply to ISA cards only, as far as I know.  The VLB    and EISA version should have no problems.   b) I'm pretty sure from my experience that the ISA version doesn't    work in systems with over 16M Ram.  There is supposed to be way    of switching the \"memory aperture\" feature off to prevent this,    but apparently it doesn't work.  I posted some \"help me\" messages    on the net and people indicated that the EISA card didn't have this    problem.  c) FALSE  d) The VLB card, which I have, allows you to set memory aperture over 32M    by using their configuration software.  No messing with jumpers necessary.     The 32M problem is probably valid only for ISA cards.   > 2) The card works in a 32M system with some switches >    set but it is much slower.  a) Again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124M RAM    (EISA and VLB) or 12 M (ISA).  32M should not be a problem for you.    b) Dunno.  c) Depends on the bus. YES if ISA, NO if EISA or Localbus   > 3) The card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.  a) Nope.  I can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all    non-interlaced.  b) Yes - According to PC Magazine, they've tested a local bus version    that does 1024x768 in 24-bit which may or may not be interlaced.  c) Not for the Pro. Sometimes for the Plus.     Some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors. This has nothing to     do with 24 bits ... only with screen size. Note that for 24 bit color    and Windows you MUST have 2 megs, memory size calculations notwithstanding.   > 4) The latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many >    cases.  a) They aren't perfect, but are much improved.  I don't recall the last time which    I had to leave mach 32 mode (ATI GUP mode) and switch to 8514 or VGA mode due    to software incompatibility.  b) True.  Many people recommended going back to Build 55 or 54.  c) They appear to be excellent, but have a few bugs. For example, certain    graphs with dashed lines in Mathcad 3.1 do not print correctly, though they    do display OK on the screen. They are about par for fancy cards ..    other accelerated cards also have bugs.  d) Overall, I like the card, even if driver performance is somewhat less than    satisfactory.  I am running the 1024*768 16 Color mode as that is all my    NT driver for October NT version seems to allow.     I will say this that Color performance is not quite as nice as a Diamond    Stealth VRAM, but I have not been able to try out a lot of the options on    the old driver.   > 5) This card is the fastest full colour card for the money.  a) It's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.   b) Yes - I'll admit it was very very fast in 16-bit mode, which is what    I wanted to use it for.  Too bad it crashed (in many different ways)    every 20 minutes or so...  c) Depends on many many things.   > 6) This card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)  a) I like it.  b) Well - PC Magazine seems to think it is.  c) Yes, this appears to be true :-)  d) As to greatest thing since sliced bread, I doubt it.  Better cards are    coming out.  Who knows, maybe ATI will come out with something faster yet.    Several reviews I read rated one Pycon Winjet card as a superior performer     at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers, which Pycon was     developing at that time.  (PC Magazine, about two months or so back)     Overall, the card has a lot of potential, but you have to be able to use it.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- That is the end of the questions. These were the most discussed items in this group so I thought they needed confirmation. For those of you not familiar with the card I have included a summary here (from an ATI ad since I don't have an Graphics Ultra yet.)  ATI Graphics Ultra Plus: - Accelerated 1024x768 at 65K colours - True colour(16.7M) at 800x600 - Multimedia Video Acceleration (for Indeo Video,RLE and Video 1 compressed)   Stretch full motion video windows to full size - Fast VGA - Includes 3 button mouse (ISA versions only) - Anti-aliased fonts (ed. avail in 16 colour mode only,I think) - Real-time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop - Around a 1/2 length card size - Priced from $400 U.S.  ATI Graphics Ultra Pro: - Everything in Graphics Ultra Plus - Faster performance with VRAMS - Accelerated 1280x1024 at 256 colours 74Hz non-interlaced - Available in ISA, EISA and Microchannel - Priced from $600 U.S.  ATI Technologies (416) 756-0718  I hope this summary can be of use to you.

I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me  that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.    As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally  occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.

Lines: 82     UPI Washington DC, Update Desk   4/15/93    For the past several months the Clinton administration has been   stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most   leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the    economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area   of jobs creation.    The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,   in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed   a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting   economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.    Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.   \"It's the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other   \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the   economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than   ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.      However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have   been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several   declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have   not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.    \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said   the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we   suspect it will\", he added.    In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new   Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's    called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,   every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index    cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw   one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any   further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the   politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.    The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the   Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run   out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,   over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the   street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee   this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject   of gun control\".    Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an   amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing   caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,   stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference   at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.    Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment   that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been   drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we'll   fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press   conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate   building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow   the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require   the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,   after all of the cards have been drawn.    The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this   thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those   guns\".    US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado   declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won't   affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".    - end article -    For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)                                   Bill Vojak                                 vojak@icebucket.stortek.com     NRA, ILA,                                 Colorado Firearms Coalition ------------------------------------------------------------ The CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

By modern standards > we are talking about a one-horse town.  Sigh, I was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000 people). I have to consult my city and inform them that it's from now a fishing village. When this city (Kristinestad) was founded in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms were even more bizarre for dumb Swedish queens who founded cities along the coast of Finland.  I would like to know why Paul thought is was worth mentioning the  small fishing place of Tyre in Acts. Again, maybe he was a keen fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of Tyre? :-)  Cheers, Kent --- sandvik@newton.apple.com. ALink: KSAND -- Private activities on the net.

You still haven't offered  I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even contributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I'd rather face a knife than a gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the same thing, then I got 'educated.'  People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick (within a minute or so) death.  The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are 'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.  Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as the attacker.  Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their knife attacks in prison.  If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3 seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the pointed end.)  Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth. Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'  This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.  The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk (a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually do this.  Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason 'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep us alive.  I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do whatever it takes.  Rick.

He/she cannot make laws.  If there is no law that covers a specific subject, say scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  So they have to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  For the California Insurance Commissioner, there are two possible legislative bodies:  the California State Legislature and the U.S. Congress.  We all know how little the California State Legislature accomplishes, esp.  along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  So Garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.  >John Eaton >!hp-vcd!johne "],["comp.os.ms-windows.misc",9.0,9.0,"From: acifuent@isluga.puc.cl (Alejandro Cifuentes) Subject: Q: Change icons forever???

However, the Mac SE cannot DISPLAY grayscale on  The original poster (W G Wright) posted an item saying that he had bought a new wizz-bang Laser Printer from Apple (a Select 300 I think) which can print GrayScale. He then said that he CANNOT PRINT GRAYSCALE from his SE computer (and also that all the 'experts' he has dealt with agree that it is not possible).  This is the one major bugbear about doing a 3rd party SE upgrade (compared to Apple's SE to SE/30 upgrade): you will never be able to run Color Quickdraw. It is Color Quickdraw that controls Color AND Grayscale.  SEs CAN print some COLOUR: this is because Quickdraw - the original, non-colour version, has the right hooks for eight colours. Some of you will remember the 'SCSIgraph' solution to getting a colour screen for your SE (I think that it gave you sixteen colours by dithering or something).  There is no reason that Apple couldn't release software patches for older computers (there are lots of Mac Pluses, Classics and SEs that have been upgraded to 68020 and 68030 processors which should be perfectly able to deal with Color Quickdraw) - but they wont, and 3rd parties are having a difficult  time in duplicating the Mac's ROMs (i.e. Nutek et al.).  Just one Caveat: I would have thought that if you were printing a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale image onto a POSTSCRIPT Grayscale printer, that you would be able to do so, whatever Mac you were using.

Neil Smith Distribution: usa Nntp-Posting-Host: blanca.lance.colostate.edu Organization: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO  80523 Lines: 116  Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith                             WEIRD SCIENCE  Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips  move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are  politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase  \"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.    Years ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice  Age might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke  and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international  unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even  have killed the dinosaurs.    What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this,  that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended  to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken  values that made America the most successful culture in history,  and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague  when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.    We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William  Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't  supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least  100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never  know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit  their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and  that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.    But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of  science as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to  unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\"  have agendas of their own.    Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is  going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that  there is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money  and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and  they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical  crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.    The same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up  by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private  industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and  foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on  specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.    The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.   \"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and  contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than  a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era  when state central planning and the command economy have failed and  can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.    Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth  and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear  power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy  known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount  of energy there is available to any individual in society, the  freer that individual -- and his society -- become.    Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and  self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as  ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive  reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have  been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.    And what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the  effect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non- smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of  magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a  week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether  there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.    That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically  correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice  to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy  practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's  science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is  highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet  the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There  isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of  government money on the scientific establishment.    Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies  to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one  time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and  religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has  tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of  abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street  -- has wound up being shed.    Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's  lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of  livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate,  to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels  for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates,  when they die from the effects of obesity.    What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two  more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of  state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable;  real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will  simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and  everyone will benefit.    L.

Did the Korean grocery store owner in New York city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters  outside his store?  Patrons inside the store could hear the  protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how  is that different from the abortion protesters asking women  to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?    > Harassment goes beyond > expression to direct attack on particular persons, > in this case the workers and clients at a clinic. > Its purpose is clearly not to convey information or > express an opinion, but to intimidate and do harm to > other others.

If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?    $0.02, doug.

A genocide of Armenians took place during peacetime.  And it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in those days. He was still young. Born in 1926.  On that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there  was unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we  didn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they wouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd  near the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home  watching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir  Street. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our  house is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields there. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the  direction of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and  started shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off  the light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the light. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know  and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.  Suddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us: there were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother Aleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War  II and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.  We went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down  with axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's  happened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we  say, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No,  leave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've  broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best we can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other.  We had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment, and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and when the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We  held the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an  axe, and then with a crowbar.  When the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them  with the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars,  pipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father  in the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the room, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother Sasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he was the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured  several of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But  they, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there were many of them.  The door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go  into the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought  skewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father  bleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head,  and his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw  that. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove them down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the  bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in  there, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to  chase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of  about 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and Mother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and  started calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no  one came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader  of the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a  fur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you,  woman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\" She says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father  was a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian  and Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says,  \"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he  brought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You  don't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this  man, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and  started running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left,  too. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't  know if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even though we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started  to massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to  call an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all  evening and all through the night.  Somewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were  from Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you  have our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay in the room.  So we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well, we say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around  one o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy,  investigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back  here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\" Then people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take  Father away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take  Father away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times, but no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the  neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should  hide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and  went up to the neighbor's.  The excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles, ZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a  landing force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A crowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings 19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking  into Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians  weren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they  poured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were  some Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still, up there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in  the two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding  one floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door  shouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling  the corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it,  and the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the  furniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed  him down.  The mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and  went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also Armenians, they had left for another city.  The father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you  crazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the  apartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave  this apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At first the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and he relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound of motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went  downstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the  other rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down.  They left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal  they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our Microdistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.  With the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were  saved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely  accidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the  crowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only able to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on  the bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We  were also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our share. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the  troops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been  even greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the  genocide.  Through an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the  leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their  orders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to ' pick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock  in the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was  quite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried  Father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were  about six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It  was gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people  there, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well,  there was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It  was something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The  child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a  man there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces  were disfigured, they were in such awful condition...  Now two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what  happened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my  father, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.  I still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was established, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what  happened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.  I'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They even fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel  mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They  weren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our  troops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right across from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The  inhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the  soldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They  weren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were  at the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket  office I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing  Armenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that  they were being burned. During those days no one from the police department  came to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though perhaps they could have come and saved us.  As we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus  station. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in  fighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in  which buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had lists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.  Thanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the leadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian people, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops  suffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my  family and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait Armenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.  At present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR Procuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could  happen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds.  Very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass  disturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught, very few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There  were around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took  part in the pogrom of our building all in all.  They should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that  retribution awaits those who perform such acts.

I think that there do exist NuBus expansion cages (I'm sure I've seen them advertised occassionally), but I think that the main problem is that they cost much more than the difference in price between say a LC and IIvx so unless you need lots of NuBus slots its not worth the bother.  (Of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because no one buys them because they are so expensive...)  NuBus technology isn't a special Apple Proprietry thing (I have this sneaky feeling that it is licensed from Texas Instruments???) so there is no problem building an expansion box.  The difference between NuBus and PDS is that NuBus is a clever interface with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work together on the same computer. PDS (processor direct slot) is just that: here are all the connections to the processor. You can do anything with this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. You may be able to get double PDS slot adaptors but you try plugging 2 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! Of course, the extra  electronics in a NuBus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so guess why Apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?  So, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.

Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team April 19; Q&A Following  To: National Desk  Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100     WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine \"Black Bears\" NCAA Division I hockey champions:                             The Rose Garden   9:58 A.M. EDT       THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.       I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to cheer them onto victory.       Coming from a state that is also relatively small in size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears. In our state people are still talking about the time we won the Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine will as proud of this team as they are today.       You know, in my state football is a slightly more popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.) But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)       In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger than me.       On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I know a little bit about.       Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from behind.       I think it's important, as I ask young people from around America who have achieved outstanding things in working together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all of our lives.       We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have them here today.  (Applause.)       (The President is presented with team jersey.) (Applause.)       THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful. (Applause.)       (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)       THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)                               * * * * * *       Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco this morning, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions to her and to the FBI.       Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it should be executed?       THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions. That was their judgment, the FBI.       Q  Is this a raid?       THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to -- talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical decisions.       Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this morning?       Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?       THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).       SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.       THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.       Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?       THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and talk some more.       Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your compromise is no compromise.       THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you   can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was the chain was regarding the tanks \"last used in Detroit in 48\".

Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.    : \"Well, it's not the main gun.\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you : now going to admit that you were wrong?  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?    --------------------------------------------------   \"I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"    --------------------------------------------------    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words, \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.    What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:   -------------------------------------------------- >We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948.   Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions it in his song \"Black Day in July\".   --------------------------------------------------    Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that means I was right.    : I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67 : riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place : without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American : military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have : been *big* news.     So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.    Awesley goes on:   You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.  : To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion : grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be : perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since : it makes your other claim seem more plausible.  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.   : If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been : screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about : it.      Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot. Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I've also heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd assert that I claimed they were truth.  : Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up.      Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks. So it would have been an Army cover-up.     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.  : If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer : to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that : those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.     Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe that they did fire their guns.

I originally wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.  *** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it *** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a *** different version.  The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes, anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a \"virtual screen\", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256 color GIF image into a buffer.

Where do they come  #from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from #whatever is societally mandated.  It's only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating meat may be perfectly legal.  # #>#Merely a question for the basis of morality #># #>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_. #># #>#1)Who is society # #>Depends on the society. # #Doesn't help.

What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive  the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom. # #  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem #>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem #>to agree that some level of interference is necessary. # #They see the need for a \"justice\" system.

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name) either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the Bradley Center.  Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but  turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too high.  Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.

The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost  every major Xian church there is.  For centuries now.  And still they  stand.  They wil withstand the miserable Southern Boobtists, I am sure. They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the  Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of  Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is  known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the  Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the  Boobtist Witch-hunt.   Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with  their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on  their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and  more Southern Boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a  handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop  'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.

The transducer can be mounted either inside the hull as I did, or on the transom. It cannot be placed in a hole drilled into your hull.   It is fully waterproof and fits into a 2\" hole in a bulkhead (that's where I had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a powerboat. It reads depth to 199' and has a backlit LCD display. It has an adjustable shallow water alarm built in.    I am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that outputs the NMEA 0183 information.

Here are the questions I have so far: 1) Is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that I could use the case? 2) The original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk removed. Can I use them to control these devices under 486? How much do I have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work? 3) How can I make SyQuest (SCSI) and cd-rom (SCSI) work on this station?  I heard that there is a cheap sound board that has SCSI controller built-in? What's quality of this board? How much usually does a SCSI control cost? Is there any ftp sites that has SyQuest driver or cd-rom driver for the PC if I can have everything hooked up OK?4) What I want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a MPC-  quality station. How much would it cost to do that? Is it worth the hussle than just buy a new 486 station? BTW, I need to buy a keyboard for it too.  Any input is welcome.  Thank you.

McConkie's views have been controversial (e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best, or erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this dispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to as \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books! (The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and speculation.

Christ's pity on the crowds as being \"like sheep without a shepherd\" rings true to me. If these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed  judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any  positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive?

Everyone,  Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:  The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse and its offset is same everywhere.  This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used. The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!! How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?  I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear) is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things complicated. Please give me a hint.  I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not. However, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\". Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?  Please post here and let the others share our interests  (I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the summary of the answers).

Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.

Note the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use is legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate. Note that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only reference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized release' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info. These people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the keys.  The criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens to go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several of them would be a better idea than CLipper!  Them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded over the last decade ofr so.  > A state-of-the-art microcircuit called the \"Clipper Chip\" has > been developed by government engineers.

The case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening of the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by the use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms is blurred yet again.                   > A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the > \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.                > A \"key-escrow\" system will be established to ensure that the > \"Clipper Chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abiding > Americans.  Lets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the word \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you. So to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions, the answer in this press release is, YES.  > ...Each device containing the chip will have two unique > \"keys,\" numbers that will be needed by authorized government > agencies to decode messages encoded by the device.

Where do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-) And as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have.

Encryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in equilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time.

The 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The RIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false assessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps YOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined in the govenment language to be non-existant.

Take a second look at \"non-toxic, non-flammable\":    MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.   Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly   on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to   the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly   to a mustard gas inhalation.     I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed    to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through    the side effects of any WEAPON, including those    \"non-toxic\" aerosols.    WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::     usually, it wont kill you    it may give you permanent CSS asthsma    but that's better than blowing a hole in your     head ...    ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN   AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most   non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME   if you hit it with the right combo.     Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;   already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.    Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,   or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air   conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light   a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when   filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT     THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING    TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of    a building have blown OUT by \"nonflammable _smoke_\"   So:   Take a little \"nonflammable aerosol\"   Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes     NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating    on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink    since the water was cut off?    liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours    Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians   move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,   armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick   and die from tear gas.    and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:     everyone burns to death.

(formerly IMSL and Precision Visuals) is in the process of securing sites for beta testing X Exponent Graphics 1.0  and C Exponent Graphics 2.0.  (Both X Exponent Graphics and C Exponent Graphics are 3GL products).  The beta period is from April 26 through  June 18.  The platform is HP9000/700 running under OS 8.07 with  ansi C 8.71 compiler.  The media will be sent on 4mm DAT cartridge  tape.  Here are some of the key facts about the two products.   X Exponent Graphics 1.0 key facts:   1. Complete collection of high-level 2D and 3D application plot types    available through a large collection of X resources. 2. Cstom widget for OSF/Motif developers. 3. Built-in interactive GUI for plot customization. 4. Easily-implemented callbacks for customized application feedback. 5. XEG 1.0, being built on the Xt Toolkit provides the user a widget     library that conforms to the expected syntax and standards familar     to X programmers. 6. XEG will also be sold as a bundle with Visual Edge's UIM/X product.    This will enable user to use a GUI builder to create the graphical    layout of an application.   C Exponent Graphics 2.0 key facts:   1. Written in C for C application programmers/developers.  The library    is 100% written in C, and the programming interface conforms to C    standards, taking advantage fo the most desirable features of C. 2. Build-in GUI for interactive plot customization.  Through mouse     interaction, the user has complete interactive graph output control    with over 200 graphics attributes for plot customization. 3. Large collection of high-level application functions for \"two-call\"    graph creation.  A wide variety of 2D and 3D plot types are available    with minimal programming effort. 4. User ability to interrupt and control the X event.  By controlling    the X event loop, when the user use the mouse to manipulate the  plot    the user can allow CEG to control the event loop or the user can     control the event loop.   If anyone is interested in beta testing either of the products, please contact Wendy Hou at Visual Numerics via email at hou@imsl.com or call 713-279-1066.     --  Jaclyn Brandt jbrandt@NeoSoft.com -- "],["sci.space",7.0,7.0,"From: enf021@cck.coventry.ac.uk (Achurist) Subject: Re: Abyss: breathing fluids Nntp-Posting-Host: cc_sysk Organization: Coventry University Lines: 31  In article <93089.204431GRV101@psuvm.psu.edu> Callec Dradja <GRV101@psuvm.psu.edu> writes: >I am a bit nervous about posting this beacause it is begining to >stray fron the topic of space but then again that doesn't seem to >stop alot of other people. :-) > >With all of this talk about breathing at high pressures, I began >to think about the movie Abyss.

I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different 'run' for each actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull (relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs, technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable approach?

Organization: UUNET Technologies Inc, Falls Church, VA, USA Lines: 31 NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net     Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a \"pusher plate\" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.    Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).    Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.    I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

Of course if there is some reason why you need to always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the keyborads focus you can always ask for KeyPress events from the root window.

Sci., Urbana, IL Lines: 107  [An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]                         April 16, 1993        INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY                              PROPOSAL         The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement  on cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of  millions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a  comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues  such as export controls which have effectively denied most people  easy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues  posed by new technology.         However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has  already reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before  any public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the  Administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone  equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed  by the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an  80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into  chips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow  agents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over  law enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The  encryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be  available to any manufacturer for incorporation into their  communications products.         This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .         First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution  before conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may  not be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may  have better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the  government as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather, independent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets  based on open standards.         Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested.  Yet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm  classified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public  and open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a  standard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.           Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed  system may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and  law enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored  publicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the  safety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive  individual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal  inquiries?           In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the  importance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into  digital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution  ought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before  the discussion even begins.  DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:  ESCROW  The 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of  whom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid  warrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts  over to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General  will be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the  Administration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal  agency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental  organization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents  yet.  Key registration would be done by the manufacturer of the  communications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person  using it.  CLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS  The Administration claims that there are no back door means by  which the government or others could break the code without  securing keys from the escrow agents and that the President will  be told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order  to prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for  an all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security  arrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results  of the investigation would then be made public.  GOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER  In order to get a market moving, and to show that the government  believes in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big  customers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service,  VP Al Gore, and maybe even the President.   FROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:  Jerry Berman, Executive Director Daniel J.

Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your question.  Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that we would \"stop doubting and believe\" (John 21:27).  The fact that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it. Without this obvious point, I would have no hope and my faith would be vanity.  Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  \"The world hates him without reason.\"  It is a direct proclamation of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we need a Saviour.  And why can't you, Brian K., accept this?  How can you?  \"The world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him.\"  (John 14:17).   The animosity and the lack of knowledge that comes out in your twistings of Robert's daily verses is very convincing testimony of the truth of John 14:17 and 16:25. I pray and hope that I do blurt out such animosity and lack of knowledge. I am not perfect either.  But regardless of that, I thank God that Jesus revealed himself to me, without whom I'd also be bumbling about blindly though arrogantly slandering the very Person who created me and who loves me.
